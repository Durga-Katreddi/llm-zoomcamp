General course-related questions
Course - When will the course start? 
The exact day and hour of the course will be 15th Jan 2024 at 17h00. The course will start with the first  “Office Hours'' live.1
* Subscribe to course public Google Calendar (it works from Desktop only).
Register before the course starts using this link.
* Join the course Telegram channel with announcements.
* Don’t forget to register in DataTalks.Club's Slack and join the channel.


Course - What are the prerequisites for this course? 
GitHub - DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp#prerequisites
Course - Can I still join the course after the start date?
Yes, even if you don't register, you're still eligible to submit the homeworks. 
Be aware, however, that there will be deadlines for turning in the final projects. So don't leave everything for the last minute.
Course - I have registered for the Data Engineering Bootcamp. When can I expect to receive the confirmation email?
You don't need it. You're accepted. You can also just start learning and submitting homework without registering. It is not checked against any registered list. Registration is just to gauge interest before the start date.
Course - What can I do before the course starts? 
You can start by installing and setting up all the dependencies and requirements:
* Google cloud account  
* Google Cloud SDK
* Python 3 (installed with Anaconda)
* Terraform
* Git
Look over the prerequisites and syllabus to see if you are comfortable with these subjects. 
Course - how many Zoomcamps in a year?
There are multiple Zoomcamps in a year, as of 2024. However, they are for separate courses:
1. Data-Engineering (Jan - Apr)
2. MLOps (May - Aug)
3. Machine Learning (Sep - Jan)        
4. LLM (June-)
There's only one Data-Engineering Zoomcamp “live” cohort per year, for the certification. Same as for the other Zoomcamps. 
They follow pretty much the same schedule for each cohort per zoomcamp. For Data-Engineering it is (generally) from Jan-Apr of the year. If you’re not interested in the Certificate, you can take any zoom camps at any time, at your own pace, out of sync with any “live” cohort. 
Course - Is the current cohort going to be different from the previous cohort?
Yes. For the 2024 edition we are using Mage AI instead of Prefect and re-recorded the terraform videos, For 2023, we used Prefect instead of Airflow. 


Course - Can I follow the course after it finishes?
Yes, we will keep all the materials after the course finishes, so you can follow the course at your own pace after it finishes.
You can also continue looking at the homeworks and continue preparing for the next cohort. I guess you can also start working on your final capstone project.


Course - Can I get support if I take the course in the self-paced mode?
Yes, the slack channel remains open and you can ask questions there. But always sDocker containers exit code w search the channel first and second, check the FAQ (this document), most likely all your questions are already answered here.
You can also tag the bot @ZoomcampQABot to help you conduct the search, but don’t rely on its answers 100%, it is pretty good though.  


Course - Which playlist on YouTube should I refer to?
All the main videos are stored in the Main “DATA ENGINEERING” playlist (no year specified). The Github repository has also been updated to show each video with a thumbnail, that would bring you directly to the same playlist below.
Below is the MAIN PLAYLIST’. And then you refer to the year specific playlist for additional videos for that year like for office hours videos etc. Also find this playlist pinned to the slack channel.
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&si=NspQhtZhZQs1B9F-
Course - ​​How many hours per week am I expected to spend on this  course?
It depends on your background and previous experience with modules. It is expected to require about 5 - 15 hours per week. [source1] [source2] 


You can also calculate it yourself using this data and then update this answer.


Certificate - Can I follow the course in a self-paced mode and get a certificate?
No, you can only get a certificate if you finish the course with a “live” cohort. We don't award certificates for the self-paced mode. The reason is you need to peer-review capstone(s) after submitting a project. You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running.


Office Hours - What is the video/zoom link to the stream for the “Office Hour” or workshop sessions? 
The zoom link is only published to instructors/presenters/TAs.
Students participate via Youtube Live and submit questions to Slido (link would be pinned in the chat when Alexey goes Live). The video URL should be posted in the announcements channel on Telegram & Slack before it begins. Also, you will see it live on the DataTalksClub YouTube Channel.
Don’t post your questions in chat as it would be off-screen before the instructors/moderators have a chance to answer it if the room is very active.


Office Hours - I can’t attend the “Office hours” / workshop, will it be recorded?
Yes! Every “Office Hours” will be recorded and available a few minutes after the live session is over; so you can view (or rewatch) whenever you want.


Homework - What are homework and project deadlines?
You can find the latest and up-to-date deadlines here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQACMLuutV5rvXg5qICuJGL-yZqIV0FBD84CxPdC5eZHf8TfzB-CJT_3Mo7U7oGVTXmSihPgQxuuoku/pubhtml
Also, take note of Announcements from @Au-Tomator for any extensions or other news. Or, the form may also show the updated deadline, if Instructor(s) has updated it.


Homework - Are late submissions of homework allowed?
No, late submissions are not allowed. But if the form is still not closed and it’s after the due date, you can still submit the homework. confirm your submission by the date-timestamp on the Course page.y
Older news:[source1] [source2] 
Homework - What is the homework URL in the homework link?  
Answer: In short, it’s your repository on github, gitlab, bitbucket, etc
In long, your repository or any other location you have your code where a reasonable person would look at it and think yes, you went through the week and exercises.
Homework and Leaderboard - what is the system for points in the course management platform?
After you submit your homework it will be graded based on the amount of questions in a particular homework. You can see how many points you have right on the page of the homework up top. Additionally in the leaderboard you will find the sum of all points you’ve earned - points for Homeworks, FAQs and Learning in Public. If homework is clear, others work as follows: if you submit something to FAQ, you get one point, for each learning in a public link you get one point.

Environment - Is Python 3.9 still the recommended version to use in 2024?
Yes, for simplicity (of troubleshooting against the recorded videos) and stability. [source]
But Python 3.10 and 3.11 should work fine.
Environment - Should I use my local machine, GCP, or GitHub Codespaces for my environment?
You can set it up on your laptop or PC if you prefer to work locally from your laptop or PC.
You might face some challenges, especially for Windows users. If you face cnd2
If you prefer to work on the local machine, you may start with the week 1 Introduction to Docker and follow through.
However, if you prefer to set up a virtual machine, you may start with these first:
1. Using GitHub Codespaces
2. Setting up the environment on a cloudV Mcodespace
I decided to work on a virtual machine because I have different laptops & PCs for my home & office, so I can work on this boot camp virtually anywhere.


* Environment - Is GitHub codespaces an alternative to using cli/git bash to ingest the data and create a docker file?
GitHub Codespaces offers you computing Linux resources with many pre-installed tools (Docker, Docker Compose, Python).
You can also open any GitHub repository in a GitHub Codespace.                




Environment - Do we really have to use GitHub codespaces? I already have PostgreSQL & Docker installed.
It's up to you which platform and environment you use for the course.
Github codespaces or GCP VM are just possible options, but you can do the entire course from your laptop.


Environment - Do I need both GitHub Codespaces and GCP?
Choose the approach that aligns the most with your idea for the end project
One of those should suffice. However, BigQuery, which is part of GCP, will be used, so learning that is probably a better option. Or you can set up a local environment for most of this course.
Environment - Could not establish connection to "MyServerName": Got bad result from install script
This happens when attempting to connect to a GCP VM using VSCode on a Windows machine. Changing registry value in registry editor 


1. To open Run command window, you can either: 
(1-1) Use the shortcut keys: 'Windows + R', or 
(1-2) Right Click "Start", and click "Run" to open. 
2. Registry Values Located in Registry Editor, to open it: Type 'regedit' in the Run command window, and then press Enter.' 3. Now you can change the registry values "Autorun" in "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" from "if exists" to a blank.
Alternatively, You can simplify the solution by deleting the fingerprint saved within the known_hosts file. In Windows, this file is placed at  C:\Users\<your_user_name>\.ssh\known_host
Environment - Why are we using GCP and not other cloud providers?
For uniformity at least, but you’re not restricted to GCP, you can use other cloud platforms like AWS if you’re comfortable with other cloud platforms, since you get every service that’s been provided by GCP in Azure and AWS or others..
Because everyone has a google account, GCP has a free trial period and gives $300 in credits  to new users. Also, we are working with BigQuery, which is a part of GCP.
Note that to sign up for a free GCP account, you must have a valid credit card.
Should I pay for cloud services?
No, if you use GCP and take advantage of their free trial.


Environment - The GCP and other cloud providers are unavailable in some countries. Is it possible to provide a guide to installing a home lab?
You can do most of the course without a cloud. Almost everything we use (excluding BigQuery) can be run locally. We won’t be able to provide guidelines for some things, but most of the materials are runnable without GCP.
For everything in the course, there’s a local alternative. You could even do the whole course locally.


Environment - I want to use AWS. May I do that?
Yes, you can. Just remember to adapt all the information on the videos to AWS. Besides, the final capstone will be evaluated based on the task: Create a data pipeline! Develop a visualisation!
The problem would be when you need help. You’d need to rely on  fellow coursemates who also use AWS (or have experience using it before), which might be in smaller numbers than those learning the course with GCP.
Also see Is it possible to use x tool instead of the one tool you use?


Besides the “Office Hour” which are the live zoom calls?
We will probably have some calls during the Capstone period to clear some questions but it will be announced in advance if that happens.




Are we still using the NYC Trip data for January 2021? Or are we using the 2022 data? 
We will use the same data, as the project will essentially remain the same as last year’s. The data is available here


Is the 2022 repo deleted?
No, but we moved the 2022 stuff here 


Can I use Airflow instead for my final project? 
Yes, you can use any tool you want for your project.  
 
Is it possible to use tool “X” instead of the one tool you use in the course? 
Yes, this applies if you want to use Airflow or Prefect instead of Mage, AWS or Snowflake instead of GCP products or Tableau instead of Metabase or Google data studio. 
The course covers 2 alternative data stacks, one using GCP and one using local installation of everything. You can use one of them or use your tool of choice.
Should you consider it instead of the one tool you use? That we can’t support you if you choose to use a different stack, also you would need to explain the different choices of tool for the peer review of your capstone project.


How can we contribute to the course?
Star the repo! Share it with friends if you find it useful ❣️
Create a PR if you see you can improve the text or the structure of the repository. 


Environment - Is the course [Windows/mac/Linux/...] friendly? 
Yes! Linux is ideal but technically it should not matter. Students last year used all 3 OSes successfully 


Environment - Roadblock for Windows users in modules with *.sh (shell scripts). 
Have no idea how past cohorts got past this as I haven't read old slack messages, and no FAQ entries that I can find.
Later modules (module-05 & RisingWave workshop) use shell scripts in *.sh files and most Windows users not using WSL would hit a wall and cannot continue, even in git bash or MINGW64. This is why WSL environment setup is recommended from the start.
Any books or additional resources you recommend? 
Yes to both! check out this document: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/awesome-data-engineering.md 


Project - What is Project Attempt #1 and Project Attempt #2 exactly?
You will have two attempts for a project. If the first project deadline is over and you’re late or you submit the project and fail the first attempt, you have another chance to submit the project with the second attempt.


How to troubleshoot issues
The first step is to try to solve the issue on your own. Get used to solving problems and reading documentation. This will be a real life skill you need when employed. [ctrl+f] is your friend, use it! It is a universal shortcut and works in all apps/browsers.


1. What does the error say? There will often be a description of the error or instructions on what is needed or even how to fix it. I have even seen a link to the solution. Does it reference a specific line of your code?
2. Restart app or server/pc. 
3. Google it, use ChatGPT, Bing AI etc. 
   1. It is going to be rare that you are the first to have the problem, someone out there has posted the fly issue and likely the solution. 
   2. Search using: <technology> <problem statement>. Example: pgcli error column c.relhasoids does not exist. 
   3. There are often different solutions for the same problem due to variation in environments. 
4. Check the tech’s documentation. Use its search if available or use the browsers search function. 
5. Try uninstall (this may remove the bad actor) and reinstall of application or reimplementation of action. Remember to restart the server/pc for reinstalls.
   1. Sometimes reinstalling fails to resolve the issue but works if you uninstall first.
6. Post your question to Stackoverflow. Read the Stackoverflow guide on posting good questions.
   1. https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask 
   2. This will be your real life. Ask an expert in the future (in addition to coworkers). 
7. Ask in Slack
   1. Before asking a question, 
      1. Check Pins (where the shortcut to the repo and this FAQ is located)
      2. Use the slack app’s search function
      3. Use the bot @ZoomcampQABot to do the search for you
      4. check the FAQ (this document), use search [ctrl+f]
   2. When asking a question, include as much information as possible:
      1. What are you coding on? What OS?
      2. What command did you run, which video did you follow? Etc etc
      3. What error did you get? Does it have a line number to the “offending” code and have you check it for typos?
      4. What have you tried that did not work? This answer is crucial as without it, helpers would ask you to do the suggestions in the error log first. Or just read this FAQ document.
   3. DO NOT use screenshots, especially don’t take pictures from a phone.
   4. DO NOT tag instructors, it may discourage others from helping you. Copy and paste errors; if it’s long, just post it in a reply to your thread. 
      1. Use ``` for formatting your code.
   5. Use the same thread for the conversation (that means reply to your own thread). 
      1. DO NOT create multiple posts to discuss the issue.
      2. learYou may create a new post if the issue reemerges down the road. Describe what has changed in the environment.
   6. Provide additional information in the same thread of the steps you have taken for resolution.
8. Take a break and come back later. You will be amazed at how often you figure out the solution after letting your brain rest. Get some fresh air, workout, play a video game, watch a tv show, whatever allows your brain to not think about it for a little while or even until the next day. 
9. Remember technology issues in real life sometimes take days or even weeks to resolve.
10.  If somebody helped you with your problem and it's not in the FAQ, please add it there. It will help other students.




How to ask questions
When the troubleshooting guide above does not help resolve it and you need another pair of eyeballs to spot mistakes. When asking a question, include as much information as possible:


1. What are you coding on? What OS?
2. What command did you run, which video did you follow? Etc etc
3. What error did you get? Does it have a line number to the “offending” code and have you check it for typos?
4. What have you tried that did not work? This answer is crucial as without it, helpers would ask you to do the suggestions in the error log first. Or just read this FAQ document.


How do I use Git / GitHub for this course?
After you create a GitHub account, you should clone the course repo to your local machine using the process outlined in this video: Git for Everybody: How to Clone a Repository from GitHub
Having this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).
You will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository
Remember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private). 
This is also a great resource: https://dangitgit.com/
VS Code: Tab using spaces
Error: Makefile:2: *** missing separator.  Stop.
Solution: Tabs in document should be converted to Tab instead of spaces. Follow this stack.


Opening an HTML file with a Windows browser from Linux running on WSL
If you’re running Linux on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2, you can open HTML files from the guest (Linux) with whatever Internet Browser you have installed on the host (Windows). Just install wslu and open the page with wslview <file>, for example:
wslview index.html
You can customise which browser to use by setting the BROWSER environment variable first. For example:
export BROWSER='/mnt/c/Program Files/Firefox/firefox.exe'
Set up Chrome Remote Desktop for Linux on Compute Engine
This tutorial shows you how to set up the Chrome Remote Desktop service on a Debian Linux virtual machine (VM) instance on Compute Engine. Chrome Remote Desktop allows you to remotely access applications with a graphical user interface.


Certificate - generating, receiving after projects graded
Q: When will it be sent out / released?
Q: How do I get my certificate after project(s) have been reviewed and graded?
A: There’ll be an announcement in Telegram and the course channel for 
(1) checking that your proper full name is how you want displayed on the Certificate (see Editing course profile on the Course Management webpage), and
(2)  when the grading is completed. 
After second announcement, please follow instructions in https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/certificates.md on how to generate the Certificate document yourself.



Module 1: Docker and Terraform


Taxi Data - Yellow Taxi Trip Records downloading error, Error no or XML error webpage


When you try to download the 2021 data from TLC website, you get this error:


If you click on the link, and ERROR 403: Forbidden on the terminal.   
We have a backup, so use it instead: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data
So the link should be https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz
  Note: Make sure to unzip the “gz” file (no, the “unzip” command won’t work for this.)
“gzip -d file.gz”g


Taxi Data - How to handle taxi data files, now that the files are available as *.csv.gz?
In this video, we store the data file as “output.csv”. The data file won’t store correctly if the file extension is csv.gz instead of csv. One alternative is to replace csv_name = “output.cs -v” with the file name given at the end of the URL. Notice that the URL for the yellow taxi data is: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz where the highlighted part is the name of the file. We can parse this file name from the URL and use it as csv_name. That is, we can replace csv_name = “output.csv” with
csv_name = url.split(“/”)[-1] . Then when we use csv_name to using pd.read_csv, there won’t be an issue even though the file name really has the extension csv.gz instead of csv since the pandas read_csv function can read csv.gz files directly.
Taxi Data - Data Dictionary for NY Taxi data?
Yellow Trips: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf
Green Trips: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_green.pdf


Taxi Data - Unzip Parquet file
You can unzip this downloaded parquet file, in the command line. The result is a csv file which can be imported with pandas using the pd.read_csv() shown in the videos.


‘’’gunzip green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz’’’
SOLUTION TO USING PARQUET FILES DIRECTLY IN PYTHON SCRIPT ingest_data.py
In the def main(params) add this line
parquet_name= 'output.parquet'
Then edit the code which downloads the files
os.system(f"wget {url} -O {parquet_name}")
Convert the download .parquet file to csv and rename as csv_name to keep it relevant to the rest of the code
df = pd.read_parquet(parquet_name)
df.to_csv(csv_name, index=False)
wget is not recognized as an internal or external command
“wget is not recognized as an internal or external command”, you need to install it.


On Ubuntu, run:
$ sudo apt-get install wget


On MacOS, the easiest way to install wget is to use Brew:
$ brew install wget


On Windows, the easiest way to install wget is to use Chocolatey:
$ choco install wget

Or you can download a binary (https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm) and put it to any location in your PATH (e.g. C:/tools/)


Also, you can following this step to install Wget on MS Windows
* Download the latest wget binary for windows from [eternallybored] (https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/) (they are available as a zip with documentation, or just an exe)
* If you downloaded the zip, extract all (if windows built in zip utility gives an error, use [7-zip] (https://7-zip.org/)).
* Rename the file `wget64.exe` to `wget.exe` if necessary.
* Move wget.exe to your `Git\mingw64\bin\`.
Alternatively, you can use a Python wget library, but instead of simply using “wget” you’ll need to use         


python -m wget


You need to install it with pip first:
pip install wget


Alternatively, you can just paste the file URL into your web browser and download the file normally that way. You’ll want to move the resulting file into your working directory.


Also recommended a look at the python library requests for the loading gz file  https://pypi.org/project/requests


wget - ERROR: cannot verify <website> certificate  (MacOS)
Firstly, make sure that you add “!” before wget if you’re running your command in a Jupyter Notebook or CLI. Then, you can check one of this 2 things (from CLI):
1. Using the Python library wget you installed with pip, try python -m wget <url>


2. Write the usual command and add --no-check-certificate at the end. So it should be:
!wget <website_url> --no-check-certificate


Git Bash - Backslash as an escape character in Git Bash for Windows
For those who wish to use the backslash as an escape character in Git Bash for Windows (as Alexey normally does), type in the terminal: bash.escapeChar=\ (no need to include in .bashrc)
GitHub Codespaces - How to store secrets 
Instruction on how to store secrets that will be avialable in GitHub  Codespaces.

Docker - Cannot connect to Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
Make sure you're able to start the Docker daemon, and check the issue immediately down below:
And don’t forget to update the wsl in powershell the  command is wsl –update
Docker - Error during connect: In the default daemon configuration on Windows, the docker client must be run with elevated privileges to connect.: Post: "http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2Fdocker_engine/v1.24/containers/create" : open //./pipe/docker_engine: The system cannot find the file specified


As the official Docker for Windows documentation says, the Docker engine can either use the
 Hyper-V or WSL2 as its backend. However, a few constraints might apply


* Windows 10 Pro / 11 Pro Users: 
In order to use Hyper-V as its back-end, you MUST have it enabled first, which you can do by following the tutorial: Enable Hyper-V Option on Windows 10 / 11

* Windows 10 Home / 11 Home Users: 
On the other hand, Users of the 'Home' version do NOT have the option Hyper-V option enabled, which means, you can only get Docker up and running using the WSL2 credentials(Windows Subsystem for Linux). Url

You can find the detailed instructions to do so here: rt ghttps://pureinfotech.com/install-wsl-windows-11/
In case, you run into another issue while trying to install WSL2 (WslRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0x800701bc), Make sure you update the WSL2 Linux Kernel, following the guidelines here: 

https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5393
Docker - docker pull dbpage
Whenever a `docker pull is performed (either manually or by `docker-compose up`), it attempts to fetch the given image name (pgadmin4, for the example above) from a repository (dbpage). 


IF the repository is public, the fetch and download happens without any issue whatsoever.


For instance: 
   * docker pull postgres:13
   * docker pull dpage/pgadmin4        


BE ADVISED:

The Docker Images we'll be using throughout the Data Engineering Zoomcamp are all public (except when or if explicitly said otherwise by the instructors or co-instructors).

Meaning: you are NOT required to perform a docker login to fetch them. 

So if you get the message above saying "docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied. That is most likely due to a typo in your image name:

For instance:

$ docker pull dbpage/pgadmin4
Will throw that exception telling you "repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'

Error response from daemon: pull access denied for dbpage/pgadmin4, repository does not exist or 
may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied
But that actually happened because the actual image is dpage/pgadmin4 and NOT dbpage/pgadmin4


How to fix it:
$ docker pull dpage/pgadmin4 


EXTRA NOTES:

In the real world, occasionally, when you're working for a company or closed organisation, the Docker image you're trying to fetch might be under a private repo that your DockerHub Username was granted access to. 


For which cases, you must first execute:
$ docker login

   * Fill in the details of your username and password. 
   * And only then perform the `docker pull` against that private repository


Why am I encountering a "permission denied" error when creating a PostgreSQL Docker container for the New York Taxi Database with a mounted volume on macOS M1?

You encounter the error message:
docker: Error response from daemon: error while creating mount source path '/path/to/ny_taxi_postgres_data': chown /path/to/ny_taxi_postgres_data: permission denied.


Solution:        
1- Stop Rancher Desktop:
   * If you are using Rancher Desktop and face this issue, stop Rancher Desktop to resolve compatibility problems.
2- Install Docker Desktop:
   * Install Docker Desktop, ensuring that it is properly configured and has the required permissions.
2-Retry Docker Command:
   * Run the Docker command again after switching to Docker Desktop. This step resolves compatibility issues on some systems.
Note: The issue occurred because Rancher Desktop was in use. Switching to Docker Desktop resolves compatibility problems and allows for the successful creation of PostgreSQL containers with mounted volumes for the New York Taxi Database on macOS M1.


Docker - can’t delete local folder that mounted to docker volume
When I runned command to create postgre in docker container it created folder on my local machine to mount it to volume inside container. It has write and read protection and owned by user 999, so I could not delete it by simply drag to trash.  My obsidian could not started due to access error, so I had to change placement of this folder and delete old folder by this command:
sudo rm -r -f docker_test/
- where `rm` - remove, `-r` - recursively, `-f` - force, `docker_test/` - folder.


Docker - Docker won't start or is stuck in settings (Windows 10 / 11)


   * First off, make sure you're running the latest version of Docker for Windows, which you can download from here. Sometimes using the menu to "Upgrade" doesn't work (which is another clear indicator for you to uninstall, and reinstall with the latest version)
 
   * If docker is stuck on starting, first try to switch containers by right clicking the docker symbol from the running programs and switch the containers from windows to linux or vice versa


   * [Windows 10 / 11 Pro Edition] The Pro Edition of Windows can run Docker either by using Hyper-V or WSL2 as its backend (Docker Engine)

      * In order to use Hyper-V as its back-end, you MUST have it enabled first, which you can do by following the tutorial: Enable Hyper-V Option on Windows 10 / 11

      * If you opt-in for WSL2, you can follow the same steps as detailed in the tutorial here
Should I run docker commands from the windows file system or a file system of a Linux distribution in WSL?
It is recommended by the Docker do
         * [Windows 10 / 11 Home Edition] If you're running a Home Edition, you can still make it work with WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) by following the tutorial here


If even after making sure your WSL2 (or Hyper-V) is set up accordingly, Docker remains stuck, you can try the option to Reset to Factory Defaults or do a fresh install.


Docker - cs to store all code in your default Linux distro to get the best out of file system performance (since Docker runs on WSL2 backend by default for Windows 10 Home / Windows 11 Home users).

Docker - The input device is not a TTY (Docker run for Windows)
You may have this error:
$ docker run -it ubuntu bash
the input device is not a TTY. If you are using mintty, try prefixing the command with 'winpty'
error:
Solution:
Use winpty before docker command (source)
$ winpty docker run -it ubuntu bash


You also can make an alias:
echo "alias docker='winpty docker'" >> ~/.bashrc

OR
echo "alias docker='winpty docker'" >> ~/.bash_profile

Possible solution might be:
$ winpty docker run -it --dns=8.8.8.8 --entrypoint=bash python:3.9


Docker - ny_taxi_postgres_data is empty


Even after properly running the docker script the folder is empty in the vs code  then try this (For Windows)


 winpty docker run -it \
  -e POSTGRES_USER="root" \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="root" \
  -e POSTGRES_DB="ny_taxi" \
  -v "C:\Users\abhin\dataengg\DE_Project_git_connected\DE_OLD\week1_set_up\docker_sql/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data" \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:13


Here quoting the absolute path in  the -v parameter is solving the issue and all the files are visible in the Vs-code ny_taxi folder as shown in the video


Docker - Setting up Docker on Mac

fixing permissions on existing directory /var/lib/postgresql/data ... initdb: f
error: could not change permissions of directory "/var/lib/postgresql/data": Operation not permitted  volume
One way to solve this issue is to create a local docker volume and map it to postgres data directory /var/lib/postgresql/data
The input dtc_postgres_volume_local must match in both commands below


$ docker volume create --name dtc_postgres_volume_local -d local
$ docker run -it\
  -e POSTGRES_USER="root" \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="root" \
  -e POSTGRES_DB="ny_taxi" \
  -v dtc_postgres_volume_local:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 5432:5432\
  postgres:13


To verify the above command works in (WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04, verified 2024-Jan), go to the Docker Desktop app and look under Volumes - dtc_postgres_volume_local would be listed there. The folder ny_taxi_postgres_data would however be empty, since we used an alternative config.


An alternate error could be:


initdb: error: directory "/var/lib/postgresql/data" exists but is not empty
If you want to create a new database system, either remove or empthe directory "/var/lib/postgresql/data" or run initdb
witls


Docker - invalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase (Mounting volumes with Docker on Windows)
Mapping volumes on Windows could be tricky. The way it was done in the course video doesn’t work for everyone.


First, if you
 move your data to some folder without spaces. E.g. if your code is in “C:/Users/Alexey Grigorev/git/…”, move it to “C:/git/…”
Try replacing the “-v” part with one of the following options:
         * -v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
         * -v //c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
         * -v /c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
         * -v //c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
         * --volume //driveletter/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data
 winpty docker run -it 
   -e POSTGRES_USER="root" 
   -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="root" 
   -e POSTGRES_DB="ny_taxi" 
   -v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data 
   -p 5432:5432 
    postgres:1
Try adding winpty before the whole command
3 
win
Try adding quotes:
         * -v "/c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data"
         * -v "//c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data"
         * -v “/c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data"
         * -v "//c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data"
         * -v "c:\some\path\ny_taxi_postgres_data":/var/lib/postgresql/data
Note:  (Window) if it automatically creates a folder called “ny_taxi_postgres_data;C” suggests you have problems with volume mapping, try deleting both folders and replacing “-v” part with other options. For me “//c/” works instead of “/c/”. And it will work by automatically creating a correct folder called “ny_taxi_postgres_data”.
A possible solution to this error would be to use /”$(pwd)”/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data (with quotes’ position varying as in the above list).        


Yes for windows use the command it works perfectly fine
         * -v /”$(pwd)”/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data


Important: note how the quotes are placed. 
If none of these options work, you can use a volume name instead of the path:
         * -v ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
For Mac: You can wrap $(pwd) with quotes like the highlighted.
docker run -it \
  -e POSTGRES_USER="root" \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="root" \
  -e POSTGRES_DB="ny_taxi" \
  -v "$(pwd)"/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  Postgres:13


docker run -it \
     -e POSTGRES_USER="root" \
      -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="root" \
      -e POSTGRES_DB="ny_taxi" \
      -v "$(pwd)"/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
      -p 5432:5432 \
      postgres:13

Docker - build error: error checking context: 'can't stat '/home/user/repos/data-engineering/week_1_basics_n_setup/2_docker_sql/ny_taxi_postgres_data''.
This error appeared when running the command: docker build -t taxi_ingest:v001 .
When feeding the database with the data the user id of the directory ny_taxi_postgres_data was changed to 999, so my user couldn’t access it when running the above command. Even though this is not the problem here it helped to raise the error due to the permission issue.
Since at this point we only need the files Dockerfile and ingest_data.py, to fix this error one can run the docker build command on a different directory (having only these two files).
A more complete explanation can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41286028/docker-build-error-checking-context-cant-stat-c-users-username-appdata


You can fix the problem by changing the permission of the directory on ubuntu with following command:

Docker - build error checking context: can’t stat ‘/home/fhrzn/Projects/…./ny_taxi_postgres_data’
Found the issue in the PopOS linux. It happened because our user didn’t have authorization rights to the host folder ( which also caused folder seems empty, but it didn’t!).
✅Solution:
Just add permission for everyone to the corresponding folder
sudo chmod -R 777 <path_to_folder>
Example:
sudo chmod -R 777 ny_taxi_postgres_data/


Docker - failed to solve with frontend dockerfile.v0: failed to read dockerfile: error from sender: open ny_taxi_postgres_data: permission denied.
This happens on Ubuntu/Linux systems when trying to run the command to build the Docker container again.
$ docker build -t taxi_ingest:v001 .
A folder is created to host the Docker files. When the build command is executed again to rebuild the pipeline or create a new one the error is raised as there are no permissions on this new folder. Grant permissions by running this comtionmand;
$ sudo chmod -R 755 ny_taxi_postgres_data
Or use 777 if you still see problems. 755 grants write access to only the owner.

Docker - Docker network name 
Get the network name via: $ docker network ls.


Docker - Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "pg-database" is already in use by container “xxx”.  You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
Sometimes, when you try to restart a docker image configured with a network name, the above message appears. In this case, use the following command with the appropriate container name:
>>> If the container is running state, use docker stop <container_name>
>>> then, docker rm pg-database
Or use docker start instead of docker run in order to restart the docker image without removing it.


Docker - ingestion when using docker-compose could not translate host name
Typical error:n.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) could not translate host name "pgdatabase" to address: Name or service not known
When running docker-compose up -d see which network is created and use this for the ingestions script instead of pg-network and see the name of the database to use instead of pgdatabase
E.g.: 
         * pg-network becomes 2docker_default
         * Pgdatabase becomes 2docker-pgdatabase-1


Docker - Cannot install docker on MacOS/Windows 11 VM running on top of Linux (due to Nested virtualization).

Docker - Connecting from VS Code
It’s very easy to manage your docker container, images, network and compose projects from VS Code.

It will work even if your Docker runs on WSL2, as VS Code can easily connect with your Linux.

Docker - How to stop a container?
Use the following command:
$ docker stop <container_id>


Docker - PostgreSQL Database directory appears to contain a database. Database system is shut down
When you see this in logs, your container with postgres is not accepting any requests, so if you attempt to connect, you'll get this error:
connection failed: server closed the connection unexpectedly
This probably means the server terminated abnormally before or while processing the request.
In this case, you need to delete the directory with data (the one you map to the container with the -v flag) and restart the container. 
Docker not installable on Ubuntu
On few versions of Ubuntu, snap command can be used to install Docker. 
sudo snap install docker
 
Docker-Compose - mounting error
error: could not change permissions of directory "/var/lib/postgresql/data": Operation not permitted  volume 
if you have used the prev answer (just before this) and have created a local docker volume, then you need to tell the compose file about the named volume:
        
volumes:  
dtc_postgres_volume_local:  # Define the named volume here


# services mentioned in the compose file auto become part of the same network!
services:
your remaining code here . . . 


         * now use docker volume inspect dtc_postgres_volume_local to see the location by checking the value of Mountpoint
         * In my case, after i ran docker compose up the mounting dir created was named ‘docker_sql_dtc_postgres_volume_local’ whereas it should have used the already existing ‘dtc_postgres_volume_local’
         * All i did to fix this is that I renamed the existing ‘dtc_postgres_volume_local’ to ‘docker_sql_dtc_postgres_volume_local’ and removed the newly created one (just be careful when doing this)
         * run docker compose up again and check if the table is there or not!

Docker-Compose - Persist PGAdmin docker contents on GCP 
So one common issue is when you run docker-compose on GCP, postgres won’t persist it’s data to mentioned path for example: 


services: 
        …
        …
pgadmin:
        …
        …
Volumes: 
         * “./pgadmin”:/var/lib/pgadmin:wr”


Might not work so in this use you can use Docker Volume to make it persist, by simply changing


services:
        …
        ….
pgadmin: 
        …
        …
Volumes: 
         * pgadmin:/var/lib/pgadmin
volumes:
   Pgadmin:




Docker engine stopped_failed to fetch extensions 


         * The docker will keep on crashing continuously 
         * Not working after restart
docker engine stopped 
And failed to fetch extensions pop ups will on screen non-stop 
Solution : 
         1. Try checking if latest version of docker is installed / Try updating the docker
         2. If Problem still persist then final solution is to reinstall docker 
         3. (Just have to fetch images again else no issues)




Docker-Compose - Persist PGAdmin configuration

 Persisting pgAdmin configuration (i.e. server name) is done by adding a “volumes” section:

   image: dpage/pgadmin4
   environment:
     - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@admin.com

   volumes:
     - "./pgAdmin_data:/var/lib/pgadmin/sessions:rw"
   ports:
     - "8080:80"


In the example above, ”pgAdmin_data” is a folder on the host machine, and “/var/lib/pgadmin/sessions” is the session settings folder in the pgAdmin container.
Before running docker-compose up on the YAML file, we also need to give the pgAdmin container access to write to the “pgAdmin_data” folder. The container runs with a username called “5050” and user group “5050”. The bash command to give access over the mounted volume is:
sudo chown -R 5050:5050 pgAdmin_data


Docker-Compose - dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
This happens if you did not create the docker group and added your user. Follow these steps from the link:
guides/docker-without-sudo.md at main · sindresorhus/guides · GitHub
And then press ctrl+D to log-out and log-in again. pgAdmin: Maintain state so that it remembers your previous connection
If you are tired of having to setup your database connection each time that you fire up the containers, all you have to do is create a volume for pgAdmin:
In your docker-compose.yaml file, enter the following into your pgAdmin declaration:
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: pgadmin_data
        target: /var/lib/pgadmin


Also add the following to the end of the file:ls
volumes:

Docker-Compose - docker-compose still not available after changing .bashrc
This is happen to me after following 1.4.1 video where we are installing docker compose in our Google Cloud VM. In my case, the docker-compose file downloaded from github named docker-compose-linux-x86_64 while it is more convenient to use docker-compose command instead. So just change the docker-compose-linux-x86_64 into docker-compose.


Docker-Compose - Error getting credentials after running docker-compose up -d
Installing pass via ‘sudo apt install pass’ helped to solve the issue. More about this can be found here: https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/1078


Docker-Compose - Errors pertaining to docker-compose.yml and pgadmin setup
For everyone who's having problem with Docker compose, getting the data in postgres and similar issues, please take care of the following:
         * create a new volume on docker (either using the command line or docker desktop app)
         * make the following changes to your docker-compose.yml file (see attachment)
 
         * set low_memory=false when importing the csv file (df = pd.read_csv('yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv', nrows=1000, low_memory=False))
         * use the below function (in the upload-data.ipynb) for better tracking of your ingestion process (see attachment)
  

         * Order of execution: 
         * (1) open terminal in 2_docker_sql folder and run docker compose up 
         * (2) ensure no other containers are running except the one you just executed (pgadmin and pgdatabase) 
         * (3) open jupyter notebook and begin the data ingestion 
         * (4) open pgadmin and set up a server (make sure you use the same configurations as your docker-compose.yml file like the same name (pgdatabase), port, databasename (ny_taxi) etc.

Docker-Compose - Which docker-compose binary to use for WSL?
To figure out which docker-compose you need to download from https://github.com/docker/compose/releases you can check your system with these commands:
         * uname -s  -> return Linux most likely
         * uname -m -> return "flavor"
Or try this command - 
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


Docker-Compose - Error undefined volume in Windows/WSL
If you wrote the docker-compose.yaml file exactly like the video, you might run into an error like this:dev


service "pgdatabase" refers to undefined volume dtc_postgres_volume_local: invalid compose project


In order to make it work, you need to include the volume in your docker-compose file. Just add the following:
volumes:
  dtc_postgres_volume_local:


(Make sure volumes are at the same level as services.)
WSL Docker directory permissions error
Error:  initdb: error: could not change permissions of directory
Issue: WSL and Windows do not manage permissions in the same way causing conflict if using the Windows file system rather than the WSL file system.
Solution: Use Docker volumes.
Why: Volume is used for storage of persistent data and not for use of transferring files. A local volume is unnecessary.
Benefit: This resolves permission issues and allows for better management of volumes. 
NOTE: the ‘user:’ is not necessary if using docker volumes, but is if using local drive.

Docker - If pgadmin is not working for Querying in Postgres Use PSQL
Cause : If Running on git bash or vm in windows pgadmin doesnt work easily LIbraries like psycopg2 and libpq ar required still the error persists. 


Solution- I use psql instead of pgadmin totally same
         * Pip install psycopg2
         * dock 


WSL - Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service.
Cause:
It happens because the apps are not updated. To be specific, search for any pending updates for Windows Terminal, WSL and Windows Security updates.
Solution 
         * for updating Windows terminal which worked for me:
         1. Go to Microsoft Store.
         2. Go to the library of apps installed in your system. 
         3. Search for Windows terminal.
         4. Update the app and restart your system to  see the changes.


         * For updating the Windows security updates:
         1. Go to Windows updates and check if there are any pending updates from Windows, especially security updates.
         2. Do restart your system once the updates are downloaded and installed successfully.




WSL - WSL integration with distro Ubuntu unexpectedly stopped with exit code 1.

Solution 1: Fixing DNS Issue (credit: reddit) this worked for me personally
reg add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dnscache" /v "Start" /t REG_DWORD /d "4" /f
Restart your computer and then enable it with the following
reg add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dnscache" /v "Start" /t REG_DWORD /d "2" /f
Restart your OS again. It should work.

WSL - Permissions too open at Windows
Issue when trying to run the GPC VM through SSH through WSL2,  probably because WSL2 isn’t looking for .ssh keys in the correct folder. My case I was trying to run this command in the terminal and getting an error
PC:/mnt/c/Users/User/.ssh$ ssh -i gpc [username]@[my external IP]
You can try to use sudo before the command
Sudo .ssh$ ssh -i gpc [username]@[my external IP]
You can also try to cd to your folder and change the permissions for the private key SSH file. 
chmod 600 gpc
If that doesn’t work, create a .ssh folder in the home diretory of WSL2 and copy the content of windows .ssh folder to that new folder.
cd ~
mkdir .ssh
cp -r /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/.ssh/* ~/.ssh/
You might need to adjust the permissions of the files and folders in the .ssh directory.
WSL - Could not resolve host name
Such as the issue above, WSL2 may not be referencing the correct .ssh/config path from Windows. You can create a config file at the home directory of WSL2.
cd ~
mkdir .ssh
Create a config file in this new .ssh/ folder referencing this folder:
  HostName [GPC VM external IP]
  User [username]
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/[private key]

PGCLI - INKhould we run pgcli inside another docker container? 
In this section of the course, the 5432 port of pgsql is mapped to your computer’s 5432 port. Which means you can access the postgres database via pgcli directly from your computer.
So No, you don’t need to run it inside another container. Your local system will do.
PGCLI - FATAL: password authentication failed for user "root" (You already have Postgres)
FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "root"
observations: Below in bold do not forget the folder that was created ny_taxi_postgres_data
This happens if you have a local Postgres installation in your computer. To mitigate this, use a different port, like 5431, when creating the docker container, as in: -p 5431: 5432

Then, we need to use this port when connecting to pgcli, as shown below: 
pgcli -h localhost -p 5431 -u root -d ny_taxi
This will connect you to your postgres docker container, which is mapped to your host’s 5431 port (though you might choose any port of your liking as long as it is not occupied).
For a more visual and detailed explanation, feel free to check the video 1.4.2 - Port Mapping and Networks in Docker
If you want to debug: the following can help (on a MacOS)

To find out if something is blocking your port (on a MacOS): 
         * You can use the lsof command to find out which application is using a specific port on your local machine. `lsof -i :5432`wi
         * Or list the running postgres services on your local machine with launchctl
 
To unload the running service on your local machine (on a MacOS):
         * unload the launch agent for the PostgreSQL service, which will stop the service and free up the port  
`launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist`
         * this one to start it again
`launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist`
Changing port from 5432:5432 to 5431:5432 helped me to avoid this error.

Make sure you install pgcli without sudo. 
The recommended approach is to use conda/anaconda to make sure your system python is not affected. 
If conda install gets stuck at "Solving environment" try these alternatives: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63734508/stuck-at-solving-environment-on-anaconda


PGCLI - no pq wrapper available. 
ImportError: no pq wrapper available. 
Attempts made:
- couldn't import \dt
opg 'c' implementation: No module named 'psycopg_c' 
- couldn't import psycopg 'binary' implementation: No module named 'psycopg_binary'
- couldn't import psycopg 'python' implementation: libpq library not found


Solution: 
First, make sure your Python is set to 3.9, at least.
And the reason for that is we have had cases of 'psycopg2-binary' failing to install because of an old version of Python (3.7.3). 

0. You can check your current python version with: 
$ python -V (the V must be capital)

1. Based on the previous output, if you've got a 3.9, skip to Step #2
  Otherwise better off with a new environment with 3.9
$ conda create –name de-zoomcamp python=3.9
$ conda activate de-zoomcamp 

2. Next, you should be able to install the lib for postgres like this:
```
$ e
$ pip install psycopg2_binary
```
3. Finally, make sure you're also installing pgcli, but use conda for that:
```
$ pgcli -h localhost -U root -d ny_taxisudo 
```
There, you should be good to go now!


Another solution:
Run this
pip install "psycopg[binary,pool]"


PGCLI -  stuck on password prompt
If your Bash prompt is stuck on the password command for postgres
  



Use winpty: 
winpty pgcli -h localhost -p 5432 -u root -d ny_taxi


Alternatively, try using Windows terminal or terminal in VS code.


EditPGCLI -connection failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "root"
The error above was faced continually despite inputting the correct password
Solution


Option 1: Stop the PostgreSQL service on Windows
Option 2 (using WSL): Completely uninstall Protgres 12 from Windows and install postgresql-client on WSL (sudo apt install postgresql-client-common postgresql-client libpq-dev)
Option 3: Change the port of the docker container


NEW SOLUTION: 27/01/2024


PGCLI -connection failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "root"
If you’ve got the error above, it’s probably because you were just like me, closed the connection to the Postgres:13 image in the previous step of the tutorial, which is

docker run -it \
        -e POSTGRES_USER=root \
        -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root \
        -e POSTGRES_DB=ny_taxi \
        -v d:/git/data-engineering-zoomcamp/week_1/docker_sql/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
        -p 5432:5432 \
        postgres:13


So keep the database connected and you will be able to implement all the next steps of the tutorial.


  



PGCLI - pgcli: command not found
Problem: If you have already installed pgcli but bash doesn't recognize pgcli
            * On Git bash: bash: pgcli: command not found
            * On Windows Terminal: pgcli: The term 'pgcli' is not recognized…
Solution: Try adding a Python path C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39\Scripts to Windows PATH
For details:
            1. Get the location: pip list -v
            2. Copy C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39\site-packages
            3. 3. Replace site-packages with Scripts: C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39\Scripts


It can also be that you have Python installed elsewhere. 
For me it was under c:\python310\lib\site-packages 
So I had to add c:\python310\lib\Scripts to PATH, as shown below.
Put the above path in "Path" (or "PATH") in System Variables

PGCLI - running in a Docker container
In case running pgcli  locally causes issues or you do not want to install it locally you can use it running in a Docker container instead.
Below the usage with values used in the videos of the course for:
            * network name (docker network)
            * postgres related variables for pgcli
            * Hostname
            * Username
            * Port
            * Database name

PGCLI - case sensitive use “Quotations” around columns with capital letters
PULocationID will not be recognized but “PULocationID” will be. This is because unquoted "Localidentifiers are case insensitive. See docs.
PGCLI - error column c.relhasoids does not exist
When using the command `\d <database name>` you get the error column `c.relhasoids does not exist`. 
Resolution:
            1. Uninstall pgcli
            2. Reinstall pgclidatabase "ny_taxi" does not exist
            3. Restart pc
Postgres - OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "root"
This happens while uploading data via the connection in jupyter notebook
engine = create_engine('postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi')
The port 5432 was taken by another postgres. You could already have installed Postgres in the past at the same port, so when you are trying to connect it does not reach docker, but the old Postgres installation instead. We are not connecting to the port in docker, but to the port on our machine. Substitute 5431 or whatever port you mapped to for port 5432. Another option is to remove the old Postgres installation if useless. 


Also if this error is still persistent , kindly check if you have a service in windows running postgres , Stopping that service will resolve the issue


Postgres - OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  role "root" does not exist
Can happen when connecting via pgcli 
pgcli -h localhost -p 5432 -U root -d ny_taxi
Or while uploading data via the connection in jupyter notebook
engine = create_engine('postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi')
This can happen when Postgres is already installed on your computer. Changing the port can resolve that (e.g. from 5432 to 5431).


To check whether there even is a root user with the ability to login:
Try: docker exec -it <your_container_name> /bin/bash
And then run
???
Also, you could change port from 5432:5432 to 5431:5432


Other solution that worked: 
Changing `POSTGRES_USER=juroot` to `PGUSER=postgres`
Based on this: postgres with docker compose gives FATAL: role "root" does not exist error - Stack Overflow
Also `docker compose down`, removing folder that had postgres volume, running `docker compose up` again.
Postgres - OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  dodatabase "ny_taxi" does not exist

Make sure postgres is running. You can check that by running `docker ps`
✅Solution: If you have postgres software installed on your computer before now, build your instance on a different port like 8080 instead of 5432


Postgres - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'
Issue:
  

e…
  



Solution: 
pip install psycopg2-binary


If you already have it, you might need to update it:
pip install psycopg2-binary --upgrade


Other methods, if the above fails:
            * if you are getting the “ ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2' “ error even after the above installation, then try updating conda using the command conda update -n base -c defaults conda. Or if you are using pip, then try updating it before installing the psycopg packages i.e
            * First uninstall the psycopg package
            * Then update conda or pip 
            * Then install psycopg again using pip.
            * if you are still facing error with r pcycopg2 and showing pg_config not found then you will have to install postgresql. in MAC it is brew install postgresql


Postgres - "Column does not exist" but it actually does (Pyscopg2 error in MacBook Pro M2)
In the join queries, if we mention the column name directly or enclosed in single quotes it’ll throw an error says “column does not exist”.
✅Solution: But if we enclose the column names in double quotes then it will work




 pgAdmin - Create server dialog does not appear
pgAdmin has a new version. Create server dialog may not appear. Try using register-> server instead.


pgAdmin - Blank/white screen after login (browser)
Using GitHub Codespaces in the browser resulted in a blank screen after the login to pgAdmin (running in a Docker container). The terminal of the pgAdmin container was showing the following error message:
CSRFError: 400 Bad Request: The referrer does not match the host.


Solution #1:
As recommended in the following issue  https://github.com/pgadmin-org/pgadmin4/issues/5432 setting the following environment variable solved it.
PGADMIN_CONFIG_WTF_CSRF_ENABLED="False"
Modified “docker run” command
docker run --rm -it \
    -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL="admin@admin.com" \
    -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD="root" \

    -p "8080:80" \
    --name pgadmin \
    --network=pg-network \
    dpage/pgadmin4:8.2


Solution #2:
Using the local installed VSCode to display GitHub Codespaces.


When using GitHub Codespaces in the locally installed VSCode (opening a Codespace or creating/starting one) this issue did not occur.


pgAdmin - Can not access/open the PgAdmin address via browser
I am using a Mac Pro device and connect to the GCP Compute Engine via Remote SSH - VSCode. But when I trying to run the PgAdmin container via docker run or docker compose command, I am failed to access the pgAdmin address via my browser. I have switched to another browser, but still can not access the pgAdmin address. So I modified a little bit the configuration from the previous DE Zoomcamp repository like below and can access the pgAdmin address: 
Solution #1:
Modified “docker run” command
docker run --rm -it \
    -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL="admin@admin.com" \
    -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD="pgadmin" \
    -e PGADMIN_CONFIG_WTF_CSRF_ENABLED="False" \
    -e PGADMIN_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 \
    -e PGADMIN_LISTEN_PORT=5050 \
    -p 5050:5050 \
    --network=de-zoomcamp-network \
    --name pgadmin-container \
    --link postgres-container \
    -t dpage/pgadmin4


Solution #2:
Modified docker-compose.yaml configuration (via “docker compose up” command)
  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    container_name: pgadmin-conntainer
    environment:
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@admin.com

ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _sqlite3: The specified module could not be found. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pysqlite2'


The issue seems to arise from the missing of sqlite3.dll in path ".\Anaconda\Dlls\". 
✅I solved it by simply copying that .dll file from \Anaconda3\Library\bin and put it under the path mentioned above. (if you are using anaconda) 
Python - Ingestion with Jupyter notebook - missing 100000 records
If you follow the video 1.2.2 - Ingesting NY Taxi Data to Postgres and you execute all the same 


steps as Alexey does, you will ingest all the data (~1.3 million rows) into the table yellow_taxi_data as expected.
However, if you try to run the whole script in the Jupyter notebook for a second time from top to bottom, you will be missing the first chunk of 100000 records. This is because there is a call to the iterator before the while loop that puts the data in the table. The while loop therefore starts by ingesting the second chunk, not the first.


✅Solution: remove the cell “df=next(df_iter)” that appears higher up in the notebook than the while loop. The first time w(df_iter) is called should be within the while loop.
📔Note: As this notebook is just used as a way to test the code, it was not intended to be run top to bottom, and the logic is tidied up in a later step when it is instead inserted into a .py file for the pipeline
Python - Iteration csv without error

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('path/to/file.csv.gz', /app/ingest_data.py:1: DeprecationWarning:)


If you prefer to keep the uncompressed csv (easier preview in vscode and similar), gzip files can be unzipped using gunzip (but not unzip). On a Ubuntu local or virtual machine, you may need to apt-get install gunzip first.
iPython - Pandas parsing dates with ‘read_csv’
Pandas can interpret “string” column values as “datetime” directly when reading the CSV file using “pd.read_csv” using the parameter “parse_dates”, which for example can contain a list of column names or column indices. Then the conversion afterwards is not required anymore.
pandas.read_csv — pandas 2.1.4 documentation (pydata.org)

Example from week 1
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv(
    'yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv', 
    nrows=100, 
    parse_dates=['tpep_pickup_datetime', 'tpep_dropoff_datetime'])
df.info()


which will output

Python - Pandas can read *.csv.gzip
When a CSV file is compressed using Gzip, it is saved with a ".csv.gz" file extension. This file type is also known as a Gzip compressed CSV file. When you want to read a Gzip compressed CSV file using Pandas, you can use the read_csv() function, which is specifically designed to read CSV files. The read_csv() function accepts several parameters, including a file path or a file-like object. To read a Gzip compressed CSV file, you can pass the file path of the ".csv.gz" file as an argument to the read_csv() function. 
Here is an example of how to read a Gzip compressed CSV file using Pandas:
df = pd.read_csv('file.csv.gz'
                 , compression='gzip'
                 , low_memory=False
     )


Python - How to iterate through and ingest parquet file
Contrary to panda’s read_csv method there’s no such easy way to iterate through and set chunksize for parquet files. We can use PyArrow (Apache Arrow Python bindings) to resolve that.


import pyarrow.parquet as pq


output_name = “https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.parquet”


parquet_file = pq.ParquetFile(output_name)
parquet_size = parquet_file.metadata.num_rows


engine = create_engine(f'postgresql://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{db}')


table_name=”yellow_taxi_schema”


# Clear table if exists
pq.read_table(output_name).to_pandas().head(n=0).to_sql(name=table_name, con=engine, if_exists='replace')


# default (and max) batch size
index = 65536


for i in parquet_file.iter_batches(use_threads=True):
        t_start = time()
        print(f'Ingesting {index} out of {parquet_size} rows ({index / parquet_size:.0%})')
        i.to_pandas().to_sql(name=table_name, con=engine, if_exists='append')
        index += 65536
        t_end = time()
        print(f'\t- it took %.1f seconds' % (t_end - t_start))

GCP - Unable to add Google Cloud SDK PATH to Windows
Unable to add Google Cloud SDK PATH to Windows


Windows error: The installer is unable to automatically update your system PATH. Please add  C:\tools\google-cloud-sdk\bin
if you are constantly getting this feedback. Might be that you needed to add Gitbash to your Windows path:
One way of doing that is to use conda: ‘If you are not already using it
Download the Anaconda Navigator
Make sure to check the box (add conda to the path when installing navigator: although not recommended do it anyway)


You might also need to install git bash if you are not already using it(or you might need to uninstall it to reinstall it properly)
Make sure to check the following boxes while you install Gitbash
            * Add a GitBash to Windows Terminal
            * Use Git and optional Unix tools from the command prompt


Now open up git bash and type conda init bash This should modify your bash profile


Additionally, you might want to use Gitbash as your default terminal.
Open your Windows terminal and go to settings, on the default profile change Windows power shell to git bash

From Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52561383/gcloud-cli-cannot-create-project-the-project-id-you-specified-is-already-in-us?rq=1
Project IDs are unique across all projects. That means if any user ever had a project with that ID, you cannot use it. testproject is pretty common, so it's not surprising it's already taken.


GCP - The project to be billed is associated with an absent billing account
If you receive the error: “Error 403: The project to be billed is associated with an absent billing account., accountDisabled” It is most likely because you did not enter YOUR project ID. The snip below is from video 1.3.2
The value you enter here will be unique to each student. You can find this value on your GCP Dashboard when you login.

Another possibility is that you have not linked your billing account to your current project

GCP - Where can I find the “ny-rides.json” file?
The ny-rides.json is your private file in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

And here’s the way to find it: 
GCP -> Select project with your  instance -> IAM & Admin -> Service Accounts Keys tab -> add key, JSON as key type, then click create
Note: Once you go into Service Accounts Keys tab, click the email, then you can see the “KEYS” tab where you can add key as a JSON as its key type
GCP - Do I need to delete my instance in Google Cloud? 
In this lecture, Alexey deleted his instance in Google Cloud. Do I have to do it?


Nope. Do not delete your instance in Google Cloud platform. Otherwise, you have to do this twice for the week 1 readings.

GCP Virtual Machine (VM) Size, Slow, Clean Up 
If you are progressing through the course and find that your VM is starting to become slow you can run the following commands to inspect and detect areas where you can improve this. 
NB: What size VM should I start with? I started with 30GB but this wasn’t enough, I had to restart the project with a 60GB machine so I’d recommend choosing the 60GB version.         

Commands to inspect the health of your VM: 
            * System Resource Usage:
            * top or htop: Shows real-time information about system resource usage, including CPU, memory, and processes.
            * free -h: Displays information about system memory usage and availability.
            * df -h: Shows disk space usage of file systems.
            * du -h <directory>: Displays disk usage of a specific directory.
            * Running Processes:
            * ps aux: Lists all running processes along with detailed information.
            * Network:
            * ifconfig or ip addr show: Shows network interface configuration.
            * netstat -tuln: Displays active network connections and listening ports.
            * Hardware Information:
            * lscpu: Displays CPU information.
            * lsblk: Lists block devices (disks and partitions).
            * lshw: Lists hardware configuration.
            * User and Permissions:
            * who: Shows who is logged on and their activities.
            * w: Displays information about currently logged-in users and their processes.
            * Package Management:
            * apt list --installed: Lists installed packages (for Ubuntu and Debian-based systems)

GCP VM - I cannot get my Virtual Machine to start because GCP has no resources.
            1. Click on your VM
            2. Create an image of your VM

            4. On the settings page, change the location


GCP VM - Is it necessary to use a GCP VM? When is it useful?
The reason this video about the GCP VM exists is that many students had problems configuring their env. You can use your own env if it works for you.
And the advantage of using your own environment is that if you are working in a Github repo where you can commit, you will be able to commit the changes that you do. In the VM the repo is cloned via HTTPS so it is not possible to directly commit, even if you are the owner of the repo.
GCP VM - mkdir: cannot create directory ‘.ssh’: Permission denied
I am trying to create a directory but it won't let me do it

. GCP VM - VM connection request timeout
Question: I connected to my VM perfectly fine last week (ssh) but when I tried again this week, the connection request keeps timing out.


✅Answer: Start your VM. Once the VM is running, copy its External IP and paste that into your config file within the ~/.ssh folder.
cd ~/.ssh
code config ← this opens the config file in VSCode


GCP VM -  connect to host port 22 no route to host


(reference: https://serverfault.com/questions/953290/google-compute-engine-ssh-connect-to-host-ip-port-22-operation-timed-out)Go to edit your VM.
            1. Go to section Automation
            2. Add Startup script
```
#!/bin/bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
```
               4. Stop and Start VM.


GCP VM - Port forwarding from GCP without using VS Code


You can easily forward the ports of pgAdmin, postgres and Jupyter Notebook using the built-in tools in Ubuntu and without any additional client:
               1. First, in the VM machine, launch docker-compose up -d and jupyter notebook in the correct folder.
               2. From the local machine, execute: ssh -i ~/.ssh/gcp -L 5432:localhost:5432 username@external_ip_of_vm
               3. Execute the same command but with ports 8080 and 8888.
               4. Now you can access pgAdmin on local machine in browser typing localhost:8080
               5. For Jupyter Notebook, type localhost:8888 in the browser of your local machine. If you have problems with the credentials, it is possible that you have to copy the link with the access token provided in the logs of the terminal of the VM machine when you launched the jupyter notebook command.
               6. To forward both pgAdmin and postgres use, ssh -i ~/.ssh/gcp -L 5432:localhost:5432 -L 8080:localhost:8080 modito@35.197.218.128


GCP gcloud + MS VS Code - gcloud auth hangs
               * If you are using MS VS Code and running gcloud in WSL2, when you first try to login to gcp via the gcloud cli gcloud auth application-default login, you will see a message like this, and nothing will happen
  
               * And there might be a prompt to ask if you want to open it via browser, if you click on it, it will open up a page with error message
  
               * Solution : you should instead hover on the long link, and ctrl + click the long link

The issue was with the network. Google is not accessible in my country, I am using a VPN. And The terminal program does not automatically follow the system proxy and requires separate proxy configuration settings.I opened a Enhanced Mode in Clash, which is a VPN app, and 'terraform apply' works! So if you encounter the same issue, you can ask help for your vpn provider.

'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
If you use Anaconda (recommended for the course), it comes with pip, so the issues is probably that the anaconda’s Python is not on the PATH. 
Adding it to the PATH is different for each operation system.
 
For Linux and MacOS:
                  1. Open a terminal.
                  2. Find the path to your Anaconda installation. This is typically `~/anaconda3` or `~/opt/anaconda3`.
                  3. Add Anaconda to your PATH with the command: `export PATH="/path/to/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"`.
                  4. To make this change permanent, add the command to your `.bashrc` (Linux) or `.bash_profile` (MacOS) file.
On Windows, python and pip are in different locations (python is in the anaconda root, and pip is in Scripts). With GitBash:
                  1. Locate your Anaconda installation. The default path is usually `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Anaconda3`.
                  2. Determine the correct path format for Git Bash. Paths in Git Bash follow the Unix-style, so convert the Windows path to a Unix-style path. For example, `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Anaconda3` becomes `/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3`.
                  3. Add Anaconda to your PATH with the command: `export PATH="/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3/:/c/Users/[YourUsername]/Anaconda3/Scripts/$PATH"`.
                  4. To make this change permanent, add the command to your `.bashrc` file in your home directory.
                  5. Refresh your environment with the command: `source ~/.bashrc`.
For Windows (without Git Bash):
                  1. Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.
                  2. Click on 'Advanced system settings'.
                  3. In the System Properties window, click on 'Environment Variables'.
                  4. In the Environment Variables window, select the 'Path' variable in the 'System variables' section and click 'Edit'.
                  5. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click 'New' and add the path to your Anaconda installation (typically `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Anaconda3` and C:\Users\[YourUsername]\Anaconda3\Scripts`).
                  6. Click 'OK' in all windows to apply the changes.
After adding Anaconda to the PATH, you should be able to use `pip` from the command line. Remember to restart your terminal (or command prompt in Windows) to apply these changes.




Error: error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:8080: bind: address already in use


Resolution: You need to stop the services which is using the port.
Run the following: 
```
sudo kill -9 `sudo lsof -t -i:<port>`
```
<port> being 8080 in this case. This will free up the port for use.

Error: docker build Error checking context: 'can't stat '<path-to-file>'


Resolution: This happens due to insufficient permission for docker to access a certain file within the directory which hosts the Dockerfile.
1. You can create a .dockerignore file and add the directory/file which you want Dockerfile to ignore while build.
2. If the above does not work, then put the dockerfile and corresponding script, `        1.py` in our case to a subfolder. and run `docker build ...`
from inside the new folder.

Anaconda to PIP
To get a pip-friendly requirements.txt file file from Anaconda use
 conda install pip then `pip list –format=freeze > requirements.txt`.
 `conda list -d > requirements.txt` will not work and `pip freeze > requirements.txt` may give odd pathing.

Docker - 2.2.2 Configure Mage
Issue : Docker containers exit instantly with code 132, upon docker compose up 
Mage documentation has it listing the cause as "older architecture" .
This might be a hardware issue, so unless you have another computer, you can't solve it without purchasing a new one, so the next best solution is a VM. 
This is from a student running on a VirtualBox VM, Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS, Docker version 25.0.2. So not having the context on how the vbox was spin up with (CPU, RAM, network, etc), it’s really inconclusive at this time.


WSL - 2.2.3 Mage - Unexpected Kernel Restarts; Kernel Running out of memory:
  This issue was occurring with Windows WSL 2
For me this was because WSL 2 was not dedicating enough cpu cores to Docker.The load seems to take up at least one cpu core so I recommend dedicating at least two.
Open Bash and run the following code:
$ cd ~
$ ls -la


Look for the .wsl config file:
-rw-r--r-- 1 ~1049089       31 Jan 25 12:54  .wslconfig


Using a text editing tool of your choice edit or create your .wslconfig file:
$ nano .wslconfig


Paste the following into the new file/ edit the existing file in this format and save:
*** Note - for memory– this is the RAM on your machine you can dedicate to Docker, your situation may be different than mine ***
[wsl2]
processors=<Number of Processors - at least 2!> example: 4
memory=<memory> example:4GB


Example:
  

Once you do that run: 
$ wsl --shutdown
This shuts down WSL
Then Restart Docker Desktop - You should now be able to load the .csv.gz file without the error into a pandas dataframe

MAGE - 2.2.3 OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 5431 failed: Connection refused
Check that the POSTGRES_PORT variable in the io_config.yml  file is set to port 5432, which is the default postgres port. The POSTGRES_PORT variable is the mage container port, not the host port. Hence, there’s no need to set the POSTGRES_PORT to 5431 just because you already have a conflicting postgres installation in your host machine.
MAGE - 2.2.4 executing SELECT 1; results in KeyError

Origin of Solution (Mage Slack-Channel): https://mageai.slack.com/archives/C03HTTWFEKE/p1706543947795599
Problem: This error can often be seen after solving the error mentioned in 2.2.4. The error can be found in Mage version 0.9.61 and is a side-effect of the update of the code for data-loader blocks. 
Note: Mage 0.9.62 has been released, as of Feb 5 2024. Please recheck. Solution below may be obsolete
Solution: Using a “fixed” version of the docker container
                  1. Pull updated docker image from docker-hub
 mageai/mageaidocker pull:alpha
                  2. Update docker-compose.yaml
        version: '3'
services:
  magic:
    image: mageai/mageai:alpha  <--- instead of “latest”-tag
                  3. docker-compose up
The original Error is still present, but the SQL-query will return the desired result:

GCP - 2.2.7d Deploying Mage to GCP
The video DE Zoomcamp 2.2.7 is missing  the actual deployment of Mage using Terraform to GCP. The steps for the deployment were not covered in the video.
I successfully deployed it and wanted to share some key points:
                  1. In variables.tf, set the project_id default value to your GCP project ID.
                  2. Enable the Cloud Filestore API:
                  1.  Visit the Google Cloud Console.to
                  2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library."
                  3. Search for "Cloud Filestore API."
                  4. Click on the API and enable it.
                  3. To perform the deployment:
                  1. terraform init
                  2. terraform apply
Please note that during the terraform apply step, Terraform will prompt you to enter the PostgreSQL password. After that, it will ask for confirmation to proceed with the deployment. Review the changes, type 'yes' when prompted, and press Enter.


Ruuning Multiple Mage instances in Docker from different directories
If you want to rune multiple docker containers from different directories. Then make sure to change the port mappings in the docker-compose.yml file.
ports:
      - 8088:6789


The 8088 port in above case is hostport, where mage will run on your local machine. You can customize this as long as the port is available. If you are running on VM, make sure to forward the port too. You need to keep the container port to 6789 as this is the port where mage is running.
GCP - 2.2.7d Deploying Mage to Google Cloud 


While terraforming all the resources inside a VM created in GCS the following error is shown.
Error log:

This error might happen when you are using a VM inside GCS. To use the Google APIs from a GCP virtual machine you need to add the cloud platform scope ("https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform") to your VM when it is created. 
Since ours is already created you can just stop it and change the permissions. You can do it in the console, just go to "EDIT", g99o all the way down until you find "Cloud API access scopes". There you can "Allow full access to all Cloud APIs". I did this and all went smoothly generating all the resources needed. Hope it helps if you encounter this same error.

GCP - 2.2.7d Load Balancer Problem (Security Policies quota)
If you are on the free trial account on GCP you will face this issue when trying to deploy the infrastructures with terraform. This service is not available for this kind of account.
The solution I found was to delete the load_balancer.tf file and to comment or delete the rows that differentiate it on the main.tf file. After this just do terraform destroy to delete any infrastructure created on the fail attempts and re-run the terraform apply.
Code on main.tf to comment/delete:
Line 166, 167, 168
GCP - 2.2.7d Part 2 - Getting error when you run terraform apply
If you get the following error  
  

You have to edit variables.tf on the gcp folder, set your project-id and region and zones properly. Then, run terraform apply again.
You can find correct regions/zones here: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones


Deploying MAGE to GCP  with Terraform via the VM (2.2.7) 
FYI - It can take up to 20 minutes to deploy the MAGE Terraform files if you are using a GCP Virtual Machine. It is normal, so don’t interrupt the process or think it’s taking too long. If you have, make sure you run a terraform destroy before trying again as you will have likely partially created resources which will cause errors next time you run `terraform apply`.
`terraform destroy` may not completely delete partial resources - go to Google Cloud Console and use the search bar at the top to search for the ‘app.name’ you declared in your variables.tf file; this will list all resources with that name - make sure you delete them all before running `terraform apply` again. 
Why are my GCP free credits going so fast? MAGE .tf files - Terraform Destroy not destroying all Resources 
I checked my GCP billing last night & the MAGE Terraform IaC didn't destroy a GCP Resource called Filestore as ‘mage-data-prep- it has been costing £5.01 of my free credits each day  :sob:  I now have £151 left - Alexey has assured me that This amount WILL BE SUFFICIENT funds to finish the course. Note to anyone who had issues deploying the MAGE terraform code: check your billing account to see what you're being charged for (main menu - billing) (even if it's your free credits) and run a search for 'mage-data-prep' in the top bar just to be sure that your resources have been destroyed - if any come up delete them.

File Path: Cannot save file into a non-existent directory: 'data/green'


Git won’t push an empty folder to GitHub, so if you put a file in that folder and then push, then you should be good to go. 


Or - in your code- make the folder if it doesn’t exist using Pathlib as shown here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/273227/4590385.


For some reason, when using github storage, the relative path for writing locally no longer works. Try using two separate paths, one full path for the local write, and the original relative path for GCS bucket upload.

Solution:  You probably are running out of memory on your VM and need to add more.  For example, if you have 8 gigs of RAM on your VM, you may want to expand that to 16 gigs.


GCP VM: Disk Space is full


After playing around with prefect for a while this can happen. 
Ssh to your VM and run sudo du -h --block-size=G | sort -n -r | head -n 30 to see which directory needs the most space.
Most likely it will be …/.prefect/storage, where your cached flows are stored. You can delete older flows from there. You also have to delete the corresponding flow in the UI, otherwise it will throw you an error, when you try to run your next flow.

Docker: container crashed with status code 137.
It means your container consumed all available RAM allocated to it. It can happen in particular when working on Question#3 in the homework as the dataset is relatively large and containers eat a lot of memory in general.


I would recommend restarting your computer and only starting the necessary processes to run the container. If that doesn’t work, allocate more resources to docker. If also that doesn’t work because your workstation is a potato, you can use an online compute environment service like GitPod, which is free under under 50 hours / month of use.


Timeout due to slow upload internet
In Q3 there was a task to run the etl script from web to GCS. The problem was, it wasn’t really an ETL straight from web to GCS, but it was actually a web to local storage to local memory to GCS over network ETL. Yellow data is about 100 MB each per month compressed and ~700 MB after uncompressed on memory
This leads to a problem where i either got a network type error because my not so good 3rd world internet or i got my WSL2 crashed/hanged because out of memory error and/or 100% resource usage hang.


Solution:
if you have a lot of time at hand, try compressing it to parquet and writing it to GCS with the timeout argument set to a really high number (the default os 60 seconds)


the yellow taxi data for feb 2019 is about 100MB as parquet file


gcp_cloud_storage_bucket_block.upload_from_path(
        from_path=f"{path}",
        to_path=path,
        timeout=600
    )


UndefinedColumn: column "ratecode_id", "rate_code_id" “vendor_id”, “pu_location_id”, “do_location_id” of relation "green_taxi" does not exist - Export transformed green_taxi data to PostgreSQL
This error occurs when you try to re-run the export block, of the transformed green_taxi data to PostgreSQL.
What you’ll need to do is to drop the table using SQL in Mage (screenshot below). 
  

You should be able to re-run the block successfully after dropping the table.

Since I was using slow laptop, and we have so big csv files, I used pyspark kernel in mage instead of python, How to do it?
CSV Files are very big in nyc data, so we instead of using Pandas/Python kernel , we can try Pyspark Kernel
Documentation of Mage for using pyspark kernel: https://docs.mage.ai/integrations/spark-pyspark


?



I got an error when I was deleting  BLOCK IN A PIPELINE 
So we will first delete the connection between blocks then we can remove the connection.
Mage UI won’t let you edit the Pipeline name?
While Editing the Pipeline Name It throws permission denied error.
(Work around)In that case proceed with the work and save later on revisit it will let you edit.


How do I make Mage load the partitioned files that we created on 2.2.4, to load them into BigQuery ?

                  1. Open up a Data Loader connect using SQL - RUN the command 
`DROP TABLE mage.green_taxi`
                  2. Else, Open up a Data Extractor of SQL  - increase the rows to above the number of rows in the dataframe (you can find that in the bottom of the transformer block) change the Write Policy to `Replace` and run the SELECT statement




 Git - What Files Should I Submit for Homework 2 & How do I get them out of MAGE: 
All mage files are in your /home/src/folder where you saved your credentials.json so you should be able to access them locally. You will see a folder for ‘Pipelines’,  'data loaders', 'data transformers' & 'data exporters' - inside these will be the .py or .sql files for the blocks you created in your pipeline. 
                     1. Right click & ‘download’ the pipeline itself to your local machine (which gives you metadata, pycache and other files) 
                     2. As above, download each .py/.sql file that corresponds to each block you created for the pipeline. You'll find these under 'data loaders', 'data transformers' 'data exporters'
                     3. Move the downloaded files to your GitHub repo folder & commit your changes. 


Git - How do I include the files in the Mage repo (including exercise files and homework) in a personal copy of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp repo?
Assuming you downloaded the Mage repo in the week 2 folder of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp, you might want to include your mage copy, demo pipelines and homework within your personal copy of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp repo. This will not work by default, because GitHub sees them as two separate repositories, and one does not track the other. To add the Mage files to your main DE Zoomcamp repo, you will need to:
                     * Move the contents of the .gitignore file in your main .gitignore.
                     * Use the terminal to cd into the Mage folder and:
                     * run “git remote remove origin” to de-couple the Mage repo,
                     * run “rm -rf .git” to delete local git files,
                     * run “git add .” to add the current folder as changes to stage, commit and push.
Got ValueError: The truth value of a Series is ambiguous. Use a.empty, a.bool(), a.item(), a.any() or a.all()
When try to add three assertions:
                     * vendor_id is one of the existing values in the column (currently)
                     * passenger_count is greater than 0
                     * trip_distance is greater than 0
to test_output, I got ValueError: The truth value of a Series is ambiguous. Use a.empty, a.bool(), a.item(), a.any() or a.all(). Below is my code:
data_filter = (data['passenger_count'] > 0) and (data['trip_distance'] > 0)
After looking for solutions at Stackoverflow, I found great discussion about it. So I changed my code into:
data_filter = (data['passenger_count'] > 0) & (data['trip_distance'] > 0)
Mage AI Files are Gone/disappearing
This happened when I just booted up my PC, continuing from the progress I was doing from yesterday.
After cd-ing into your directory, and running docker compose up , the web interface for the Mage shows, but the files that I had yesterday was gone.
   
If your files are gone, go ahead and close the web interface, and properly shutting down the mage docker compose by doing Ctrl + C once. Try running it again. This worked for me more than once (yes the issue persisted with my PC twice)
Also, you should check if you’re in the correct repository before doing docker compose up . This was discussed in the Slack #course-data-engineering channel
  

Mage - Errors in io.config.yaml file
  

The above errors due to “ at the trailing side and it need to be modified with ‘ quotes at both ends

Mage - ArrowException Cannot open credentials file
Problem: The following error occurs when attempting to export data from Mage to a GCS bucket using pyarrow suggesting Mage doesn’t have the necessary permissions to access the specified GCP credentials .json file. 
ArrowException: Unknown error: google::cloud::Status(UNKNOWN: Permanent error GetBucketMetadata: Could not create a OAuth2 access token to authenticate the request. The request was not sent, as such an access token is required to complete the request successfully. Learn more about Google Cloud authentication at https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication. The underlying error message was: Cannot open credentials file /home/src/...
Solution: Inside the Mage app:
                     1. Create a credentials folder (e.g. gcp-creds) within the magic-zoomcamp folder
                     2. In the credentials folder create a .json key file (e.g. mage-gcp-creds.json)
                     3. Copy/paste GCP service account credentials into the .json key file and save
                     4. Update code to point to this file. E.g.
environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = '/home/src/magic-zoomcamp/gcp-creds/mage-gcp-creds.json'
Mage - OSError

Mage - PermissionError service account does not have storage.buckets.get access to the Google Cloud Storage bucket
Problem: The following error occurs when attempting to export data from Mage to a GCS bucket. Assigned service account doesn’t have the necessary permissions access Google Cloud Storage Bucket
PermissionError: [Errno 13] google::cloud::Status(PERMISSION_DENIED: Permanent error GetBucketMetadata:... .iam.gserviceaccount.com does not have storage.buckets.get access to the Google Cloud Storage bucket. Permission 'storage.buckets.get' denied on resource (or it may not exist). error_info={reason=forbidden, domain=global, metadata={http_status_code=403}}). Detail: [errno 13] Permission denied
Solution: Add Cloud Storage Admin role to the service account:
                     1. Go to project in Google Cloud Console>IAM & Admin>IAM
                     2. Click Edit principal (pencil symbol) to the right of the service account you are using
                     3. Click + ADD ANOTHER ROLE
                     4. Select Cloud Storage>Storage Admin
                     5. Click Save


Trigger Dataproc from Mage
1. Make sure your pyspark script is ready to be send to Dataproc cluster
2. Create a Dataproc Cluster in GCP Console
3. Make sure to edit the service account and add new role - Dataproc Editor
4. Copy the python script ./notebooks/pyspark_script.py and place it under GCS bucket path
5. Make sure gcloud cli is installed either in Mage manually or  via your Dockerfile and docker-compose files. This is needed to let Mage access google Dataproc and the script it needs to execute. Refer - Installing the latest gcloud CLI
6. Use the Bigquery/Dataproc script mentioned here - https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/05-batch/code/cloud.md . Use Mage to trigger the query




Module 3: Data Warehousing

Docker-compose takes infinitely long to install zip unzip packages for linux, which are required to unpack datasets
A:
1 solution) Add -Y flag, so that apt-get automatically agrees to install additional packages
2) Use python ZipFile package, which is included in all modern python distributions


GCS Bucket - error when writing data from web to GCS:
Make sure to use Nullable dataTypes, such as Int64 when appliable.


GCS Bucket - te table: Error while reading data, error message: Parquet column 'XYZ' has type INT which does not match the target cpp_type DOUBLE. File: gs://path/to/some/blob.parquet


Ultimately, when trying to ingest data into a BigQuery table, all files within a given directory must have the same schema. 


When dealing for example with the FHV Datasets from 2019, however (see image below), one can see that the files for '2019-05', and 2019-06, have the columns "PUlocationID" and "DOlocationID" as Integers, while for the period of '2019-01' through '2019-04', the same column is defined as FLOAT.parquet




So while importing these files as parquet to BigQuery, the first one will be used to define the schema of the table, while all files following that will be used to append data on the existing table. Which means, they must all follow the very same schema of the file that created the table. 


  
 
So, in order to prevent errors like that, make sure to enforce the data types for the columns on the DataFrame before you serialize/upload them to BigQuery. Like this:
pd.read_csv("path_or_url").astype({
        "col1_name": "datatype",        
        "col2_name": "datatype",        
        ...                                        
        "colN_name": "datatype"         
})


GCS Bucket - Fix Error when importing FHV data to GCS
If you receive the error gzip.BadGzipFile: Not a gzipped file (b'\n\n'), this is because you have specified the wrong URL to the FHV dataset. Make sure to use https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/fhv/{dataset_file}.csv.gz
Emphasising the ‘/releases/download’ part of the URL.


GCS Bucket - Load Data From URL list in to GCP Bucket
  

Krishna Anand
GCS Bucket - I query my dataset and get a Bad character (ASCII 0) error?
                     * Check the Schema
                     * You might have a wrong formatting
                     * Try to upload the CSV.GZ files without formatting or going through pandas via wget
                     * See this Slack conversation for helpful tips


GCP BQ - “bq: command not found” 
Run the following command to check if “BigQuery Command Line Tool” is installed or not: gcloud components list
You can also use bq.cmd instead of bq to make it work.


GCP BQ - Caution in using bigquery:no 
Use big queries carefully,
I created by bigquery dataset on an account where my free trial was exhausted, and got a bill of $80.
Use big query in free credits and destroy all the datasets after creation.
Check your Billing daily! Especially if you’ve spinned up a VM.


GCP BQ - Cannot read and write in different locations: source: EU, destination: US - Loading data from GCS into BigQuery (different Region):
Be careful when you create your resources on GCP, all of them have to share the same Region in order to allow load data from GCS Bucket to BigQuery. If you forgot it when you created them, you can create a new dataset on BigQuery using the same Region which you used on your GCS Bucket.


  



  



This means that your GCS Bucket and the BigQuery dataset are placed in different regions. You have to create a new dataset inside BigQuery in the same region with your GCS bucket and store the data in the newly created dataset.


GCP BQ - Cannot read and write in different locations: source: <REGION_HERE>, destination: <ANOTHER_REGION_HERE>
Make sure to create the BigQuery dataset in the very same location that you've created the GCS Bucket. For instance, if your GCS Bucket was created in `us-central1`, then BigQuery dataset must be created in the same region (us-central1, in this example)
  

  



GCP BQ - Remember to save your queries
By the way, this isn’t a problem/solution, but a useful hint:
                     * Please, remember to save your progress in BigQuery SQL Editor.
                     * I was almost finishing the homework, when my Chrome Tab froze and I had to reload it. Then I lost my entire SQL script.
                     * Save your script from time to time. Just click on the button at the top bar. Your saved file will be available on the left panel.
  

Alternatively, you can copy paste your queries into an .sql file in your preferred editor (Notepad++, VS Code, etc.). Using the .sql extension will provide convenient color formatting.


GCP BQ - Can I use BigQuery for real-time analytics in this project?
Ans :  While real-time analytics might not be explicitly mentioned, BigQuery has real-time data streaming capabilities, allowing for potential integration in future project iterations.
GCP BQ - Unable to load data from external tables into a materialized table in BigQuery due to an invalid timestamp error that are added while appending data to the file in Google Cloud Storage
could not parse 'pickup_datetime' as timestamp for field pickup_datetime (position 2)
This error is caused by invalid data in the timestamp column. A way to identify the problem is to define the schema from the external table using string datatype. This enables the queries to work at which point we can filter out the invalid rows from the import to the materialised table and insert the fields with the timestamp data type.


GCP BQ - Error Message in BigQuery: annotated as a valid Timestamp, please annotate it as TimestampType(MICROS) or TimestampType(MILLIS)

Solution:
Add `use_deprecated_int96_timestamps=True` to `pq.write_to_dataset` function, like below
pq.write_to_dataset(
        table,
        root_path=root_path,
        filesystem=gcs,
        use_deprecated_int96_timestamps=True  
# Write timestamps to INT96 Parquet format
)


GCP BQ - Datetime columns in Parquet files created from Pandas show up as integer columns in BigQuery
Solution:
If you’re using Mage, in the last Data Exporter that writes to Google Cloud Storage use PyArrow to generate the Parquet file with the correct logical type for the datetime columns, otherwise they won't be converted to timestamp when loaded by BigQuery later on.
import pyarrow as pa
import pyarrow.parquet as pq
import os


if 'data_exporter' not in globals():
    from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import data_exporter


# Replace with the location of your service account key JSON file.
os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = '/home/src/personal-gcp.json' 


bucket_name = "<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>"
object_key = 'nyc_taxi_data_2022.parquet'
where = f'{bucket_name}/{object_key}'


@data_exporter
def export_data(data, *args, **kwargs):
    table = pa.Table.from_pandas(data, preserve_index=False)
    gcs = pa.fs.GcsFileSystem()


    pq.write_table(
        table,
        where,


        # Convert integer columns in Epoch milliseconds
        # to Timestamp columns in microseconds ('us') so
        # they can be loaded into BigQuery with the right
        # data type
        coerce_timestamps='us',


        filesystem=gcs
    )


Solution 2:
If you’re using Mage, in the last Data Exporter that writes to Google Cloud Storage, provide PyArrow with explicit schema to generate the Parquet file with the correct logical type for the datetime columns, otherwise they won't be converted to timestamp when loaded by BigQuery later on.
   schema = pa.schema([
       ('vendor_id', pa.int64()),
       ('lpep_pickup_datetime', pa.timestamp('ns')),
       ('lpep_dropoff_datetime', pa.timestamp('ns')),
       ('store_and_fwd_flag', pa.string()),
       ('ratecode_id', pa.int64()),
       ('pu_location_id', pa.int64()),

GCP BQ - Check BigQuery Table Exist And Delete
Reference:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60941726/can-bigquery-api-overwrite-existing-table-view-with-create-table-tables-inser
Solution:
Combine with “Create External Table using Python”, use it before “client.create_table” function.
def tableExists(tableID, client):
    """
    Check if a table already exists using the tableID.
    return : (Boolean)
    """
    try:

GCP BQ - Error: Missing close double quote (") character
To avoid this error you can upload data from Google Cloud Storage to BigQuery through BigQuery Cloud Shell using the command:
$ bq load  --autodetect --allow_quoted_newlines --source_format=CSV dataset_name.table_name "gs://dtc-data-lake-bucketname/fhv/fhv_tripdata_2019-*.csv.gz"


GCP BQ - Cannot read and write in different locations: source: asia-south2, destination: US
Solution: This problem arises if your gcs and bigquery storage is in different regions. 
One potential way to solve it: 
                     1. Go to your google cloud bucket and check the region in field named “Location”
  

                     2. Now in bigquery, click on three dot icon near your project name and select create dataset.
  

                     3. In region filed choose the same regions as you saw in your google cloud bucket
  





GCP BQ - Tip: Using Cloud Function to read csv.gz files from github directly to BigQuery in Google Cloud:
There are multiple benefits of using Cloud Functions to automate tasks in Google Cloud. 


Use below Cloud Function python script to load files directly to BigQuery. Use your project id, dataset id & table id as defined by you.


import tempfile
import requests
import logging
from google.cloud import bigquery


def hello_world(request):


    # table_id = <project_id.dataset_id.table_id>

    client = bigquery.Client()




    for month in range(4, 13):
        # Define the schema for the data in the CSV.gz files
        url = 'https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/fhv/fhv_tripdata_2019-{:02d}.csv.gz'.format(month)


        # Download the CSV.gz file from Github
        response = requests.get(url)


        # Create new table if loading first month data else append
        write_disposition_string = "WRITE_APPEND" if month > 1 else "WRITE_TRUNCATE"

GCP BQ - How to handle type error from big query and parquet data?


Problem: When you inject data into GCS using Pandas, there is a chance that some dataset has missing values on  DOlocationID and PUlocationID. Pandas by default will cast these columns as float data type, causing inconsistent data type between parquet in GCS and schema defined in big query. You will see something like this: 
error: Error while reading table: trips_data_all.external_fhv_tripdata, error message: Parquet column 'DOlocationID' has type INT64 which does not match the target cpp_type DOUBLE. 
Solution: 
                     * Fix the data type issue in data pipeline 
                     * Before injecting data into GCS, use astype and Int64 (which is different from int64 and accept both missing value and integer exist in the column) to cast the columns.


Something like:
    df["PUlocationID"] = df.PUlocationID.astype("Int64")
    df["DOlocationID"] = df.DOlocationID.astype("Int64")
NOTE: It is best to define the data type of all the columns in the Transformation section of the ETL pipeline before loading to BigQuery


GCP BQ - Invalid project ID . Project IDs must contain 6-63 lowercase letters, digits, or dashes. Some project


Problem occurs when misplacing content after fro``m clause in BigQuery SQLs.
Check to remove any extra apaces or any other symbols, keep in lowercases, digits and dashes only


GCP BQ - Does BigQuery support multiple columns partition?
No. Based on the documentation for Bigquery, it does not support more than 1 column to be partitioned.

GCP BQ - DATE() Error in BigQuery


Error Message: 
PARTITION BY expression must be DATE(<timestamp_column>), DATE(<datetime_column>), DATETIME_TRUNC(<datetime_column>, DAY/HOUR/MONTH/YEAR), a DATE column, TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(<timestamp_column>, DAY/HOUR/MONTH/YEAR), DATE_TRUNC(<date_column>, MONTH/YEAR), or RANGE_BUCKET(<int64_column>, GENERATE_ARRAY(<int64_value>, <int64_value>[, <int64_value>]))
Solution: 
Convert the column to datetime first.
df["pickup_datetime"] = pd.to_datetime(df["pickup_datetime"])
df["dropOff_datetime"] = pd.to_datetime(df["dropOff_datetime"])
GCP BQ - Native tables vs External tables in BigQuery?
Native tables are tables where the data is stored in BigQuery.  External tables store the data outside BigQuery, with BigQuery storing metadata about that external table.

GCP BQ ML - Unable to run command (shown in video) to export ML model from BQ to GCS
Issue: Tried running command to export ML model from BQ to GCS from Week 3
bq --project_id taxi-rides-ny extract -m nytaxi.tip_model gs://taxi_ml_model/tip_model


It is failing on following error:
BigQuery error in extract operation: Error processing job Not found: Dataset was not found in location US


I verified the BQ data set and gcs bucket are in the same region- us-west1. Not sure how it gets location US. I couldn’t find the solution yet.
Solution:  Please enter correct project_id and gcs_bucket folder address. My gcs_bucket folder address is 
gs://dtc_data_lake_optimum-airfoil-376815/tip_model 
Dim_zones.sql Dataset was not found in location US When Running fact_trips.sql
To solve this error mention the location = US when creating the dim_zones table 
{{ config(
    materialized='table',
    location='US'
) }}
Just Update this part to solve the issue and run the dim_zones again and then run the fact_trips
GCP BQ ML - Export ML model to make predictions does not work for MacBook with Apple M1 chip (arm architecture).
Solution: proceed with setting up serving_dir on your computer as in the extract_model.md file. Then instead of 
docker pull tensorflow/serving
use
docker pull emacski/tensorflow-serving
Then
docker run -p 8500:8500 -p 8501:8501 --mount type=bind,source=`pwd`/serving_dir/tip_model,target=/models/tip_model -e MODEL_NAME=tip_model -t emacski/tensorflow-serving
Then run the curl command as written, and you should get a prediction.
VMs - What do I do if my VM runs out of space?
                     * Try deleting data you’ve saved to your VM locally during ETLs
                     * Kill processes related to deleted files
                     * Download ncdu and look for large files (pay particular attention to files related to Prefect)
                     * If you delete any files related to Prefect, eliminate caching from your flow code


Homework - What does it mean “Stop with loading the files into a bucket.' Stop with loading the files into a bucket?”
Ans: What they mean is that they don't want you to do anything more than that. You should load the files into the bucket and create an external table based on those files (but nothing like cleaning the data and putting it in parquet format)


Homework - Reading parquets from nyc.gov directly into pandas returns Out of bounds error
If for whatever reason you try to read parquets directly from nyc.gov’s cloudfront into pandas, you might run into this error:
pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Casting from timestamp[us] to timestamp[ns] would result in out of bounds
Cause:
                     1. there is one errant data record where the dropOff_datetime was set to year 3019 instead of 2019. 
                     2. pandas uses “timestamp[ns]” (as noted above), and int64 only allows a ~580 year range, centered on 2000. See `pd.Timestamp.max` and `pd.Timestamp.min`
                     3. This becomes out of bounds when pandas tries to read it because 3019 > 2300 (approx value of pd.Timestamp.Max
Fix:
                     1. Use pyarrow to read it:
import pyarrow.parquet as pq df = pq.read_table('fhv_tripdata_2019-02.parquet').to_pandas(safe=False)
However this results in weird timestamps for the offending record


                        2. Read the datetime columns separately using pq.read_table

table = pq.read_table(‘taxi.parquet’)
datetimes = [‘list of datetime column names’]
df_dts = pd.DataFrame()
    for col in datetimes:
        df_dts[col] = pd.to_datetime(table .column(col), errors='coerce')

The `errors=’coerce’` parameter will convert the out of bounds timestamps into either the max or the min


                           3. Use parquet.compute.filter to remove the offending rows

import pyarrow.compute as pc
table = pq.read_table("‘taxi.parquet")
df = table.filter(
    pc.less_equal(table["dropOff_datetime"], pa.scalar(pd.Timestamp.max))
).to_pandas()


Question: for homework 3 , we need all 12 parquet files for green taxi 2022 right ?
Answer: The 2022 NYC taxi data parquet files are available for each month separately. Therefore, you need to add all 12 files to your GCS bucket and then refer to them using the URIs option when creating an external table in BigQuery. You can use the wildcard "*" to refer to all 12 files using a single string.
Homework - Uploading files to GCS via GUI

This can help avoid schema issues in the homework. 
Download files locally and use the ‘upload files’ button in GCS at the desired path. You can upload many files at once. You can also choose to upload a folder.
Homework - Qn 5: The partitioned/clustered table isn’t giving me the prediction I expected
Ans: Take a careful look at the format of the dates in the question.


Homework - Qn 6: Did anyone get an exact match for one of the options given in Module 3 homework Q6?
Many people aren’t getting an exact match, but are very close to one of the options. As per Alexey said to choose the closest option.


Python - invalid start byte Error Message
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa0 in position 41721: invalid start byte
Solution:
Step 1: When reading the data from the web into the pandas dataframe mention the encoding as follows:
pd.read_csv(dataset_url, low_memory=False, encoding='latin1') 
Step 2: When writing the dataframe from the local system to GCS as a csv mention the encoding as follows:
df.to_csv(path_on_gsc, compression="gzip", encoding='utf-8')


Alternative: use pd.read_parquet(url)
Python - Generators in python
A generator is a function in python that returns an iterator using the yield keyword.
A generator is a special type of iterable, similar to a list or a tuple, but with a crucial difference. Instead of creating and storing all the values in memory at once, a generator generates values on-the-fly as you iterate over it. This makes generators memory-efficient, particularly when dealing with large datasets.  
Python - Easiest way to read multiple files at the same time?
The read_parquet function supports a list of files as an argument. The list of files will be merged into a single result table.
Python - These won't work. You need to make sure you use Int64: 
Incorrect:
df['DOlocationID'] = pd.to_numeric(df['DOlocationID'], downcast=integer) or
df['DOlocationID'] = df['DOlocationID'].astype(int)
Correct:
df['DOlocationID'] = df['DOlocationID'].astype('Int64')


Prefect - Error on Running Prefect Flow to Load data to GCS
ValueError: Path /Users/kt/.prefect/storage/44ccce0813ed4f24ab2d3783de7a9c3a does not exist.
 
Remove ```cache_key_fn=task_input_hash ``` as it’s in argument in your function & run your flow again.
Note: catche key is beneficial if you happen to run the code multiple times, it won't repeat the process which you have finished running in the previous run.  That means, if you have this ```cache_key``` in your initial run, this might cause the error.


Prefect - Tip: Downloading csv.gz from a url in a prefect environment (sample snippet).
@task
def download_file(url: str, file_path: str):
    response = requests.get(url)
    open(file_path, "wb").write(response.content)
    return file_path


@flow
def extract_from_web() -> None:
file_path = download_file(url=f'{url-filename}.csv.gz',file_path=f'{filename}.csv.gz')

DBT Cloud production error: prod dataset not available in location EU 


Problem: I am trying to deploy my DBT  models to production, using DBT Cloud. The data should live in BigQuery.  The dataset location is EU.  However, when I am running the model in production, a prod dataset is being create in BigQuery with a location US and the dbt invoke build is failing giving me "ERROR 404: porject.dataset:prod not available in location EU". I tried different ways to fix this. I am not sure if there is a more simple solution then creating my project or buckets in location US. Hope anyone can help here.
Note: Everything is working fine in development mode, the issue is just happening when scheduling and running job in production


Solution: I created the prod dataset manually in BQ and specified EU, then I ran the job.
Setup - No development environment 
Error: This project does not have a development environment configured. Please create a development environment and configure your development credentials to use the dbt IDE.
The error itself tells us how to solve this issue, the guide is here. And from videos @1:42 and also slack chat
Setup - Connecting dbt Cloud with BigQuery Error
Runtime Error
dbt was unable to connect to the specified database.
  The database returned the following error:
 >Database Error
Access Denied: Project <project_name>: User does not have bigquery.jobs.create permission in project <project_name>.
Check your database credentials and try again. For more information, visit:
https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configure-your-profile


Steps to resolve error in Google Cloud:
1. Navigate to IAM & Admin and select IAM
2. Click Grant Access if your newly created dbt service account isn't listed
3. In New principals field, add your service account
4. Select a Role and search for BigQuery Job User to add
5. Go back to dbt cloud project setup and Test your connection
6. Note: Also add BigQuery Data Owner, Storage Object Admin, & Storage Admin to prevent permission issues later in the course

Issue: You don’t have permissions to write to DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp.git
Solution 1: Clone the repository and use this forked repo, which contains your github username. Then, proceed to specify the path, as in:
[your github username]/data-engineering-zoomcamp.git


Solution 2: create a fresh repo for dbt-lessons. We’d need to do branching and PRs in this lesson, so it might be a good idea to also not mess up your whole other repo. Then you don’t have to create a subfolder for the dbt project files
Solution 3: Use https link
dbt job - Triggered by pull requests is disabled when I try to create a new Continuous Integration job in dbt cloud. 
Solution:
Check if you’re on the Developer Plan. As per the prerequisites, you'll need to be enrolled in the Team Plan or Enterprise Plan to set up a CI Job in dbt Cloud.
So If you're on the Developer Plan, you'll need to upgrade to utilise CI Jobs.
Note from another user: I’m in the Team Plan (trial period) but the option is still disabled. What worked for me instead was this. It works for the Developer (free) plan.
Setup - Your IDE session was unable to start. Please contact support.
Issue: If the DBT cloud IDE loading indefinitely then giving you this error


Solution: check the dbt_cloud_setup.md  file and make a SSH Key and use gitclone to import repo into dbt project, copy and paste deploy key back in your repo setting.




DBT - I am having problems with columns datatype while running DBT/BigQuery


Issue: If you don’t define the column format while converting from csv to parquet Python will “choose” based on the first rows.
✅Solution: Defined the schema while running web_to_gcp.py pipeline.
Sebastian adapted the script:
https://github.com/sebastian2296/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/week_4_analytics_engineering/web_to_gcs.py 
Need a quick change to make the file work with gz files, added the following lines (and don’t forget to delete the file at the end of each iteration of the loop to avoid any problem of disk space) 


            file_name_gz = f"{service}_tripdata_{year}-{month}.csv.gz"
            open(file_name_gz, 'wb').write(r.content)

	Same ERROR - When running dbt run for fact_trips.sql, the task
	

	

Reason: Parquet files have their own schema. Some parquet files for green data have records with decimals in ehail_fee column.
There are some possible fixes:
Drop ehail_feel column since it is not really used. For instance when creating a partitioned table from the external table in BigQuery 
SELECT * EXCEPT (ehail_fee) FROM… 
Modify stg_green_tripdata.sql model using this line cast(0 as numeric) as ehail_fee.
Modify Airflow dag to make the conversion and avoid the error. 
pv.read_csv(src_file, convert_options=pv.ConvertOptions(column_types = {'ehail_fee': 'float64'}))
Same type of ERROR - parquet files with different data types - Fix it with pandas
Here is another possibility that could be interesting:
You can specify the dtypes when importing the file from csv to a dataframe with pandas 
pd.from_csv(..., dtype=type_dict)
One obstacle is that the regular int64 pandas use (I think this is from the numpy library) does not accept null values (NaN, not a number). But you can use the pandas Int64 instead, notice capital ‘I’. The type_dict is a python dictionary mapping the column names to the dtypes.

Ingestion: When attempting to use the provided quick script to load trip data into GCS, you receive error Access Denied from the S3 bucket
If the provided URL isn’t working for you (https://nyc-tlc.s3.amazonaws.com/trip+data/):
We can use the GitHub CLI to easily download the needed trip data from https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data, and manually upload to a GCS bucket.
Instructions on how to download the CLI here: https://github.com/cli/cli
Commands to use:
gh auth login
gh release list -R DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data
gh release download yellow -R DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data
gh release download green -R DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data
etc.
Now you can upload the files to a GCS bucket using the GUI.
Ingestion - Error thrown by format_to_parquet_task when converting fhv_tripdata_2020-01.csv using Airflow


R: This conversion is needed for the question 3 of homework, in order to process files for fhv data. The error is:
pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: CSV parse error: Expected 7 columns, got 1: B02765
Cause: Some random line breaks in this particular file.
Fixed by opening a bash in the container executing the dag and manually running the following command that deletes all \n not preceded by \r.
perl -i -pe 's/(?<!\r)\n/\1/g' fhv_tripdata_2020-01.csv
After that, clear the failed task in Airflow to force re-execution.
Hack to load yellow and green trip data for 2019 and 2020
I initially followed data-engineering-zoomcamp/03-data-warehouse/extras/web_to_gcs.py at main · DataTalksClub/data-engineering-bootcamp (github.com)
But it was taking forever for the yellow trip data and when I tried to download and upload the parquet files directly to GCS, that works fine but when creating the Bigquery table, there was a schema inconsistency issue
Then I found another hack shared in the slack which was suggested by Victoria. 
[Optional] Hack for loading data to BigQuery for Week 4 - YouTube
Please watch until the end as there is few schema changes required to be done


Move many files (more than one) from Google cloud storage bucket to Big query

DBT - When running your first dbt model, if it fails with an error: 
                              * 404 Not found: Dataset was not found in location US
                              * 404 Not found: Dataset eighth-zenith-372015:trip_data_all was not found in location us-west1


R: Go to BigQuery, and check the location of BOTH
                              1. The source dataset (trips_data_all), and
                              2. The schema you’re trying to write to (name should be         dbt_<first initial><last name> (if you didn’t change the default settings at the end when setting up your project))
Likely, your source data will be in your region, but the write location will be a multi-regional location (US in this example). Delete these datasets, and recreate them with your specified region and the correct naming format.
Alternatively, instead of removing datasets, you can specify the single-region location you are using. E.g. instead of ‘location: US’, specify the region, so ‘location: US-east1’. See this Github comment for more detail. Additionally please see this post of Sandy


 In DBT cloud you can actually specify the location using the following steps:
                              1. GPo to your profile page (top right drop-down --> profile)
                              2. Then go to under Credentials --> Analytics (you may have customised this name)
                              3. Click on Bigquery >
                              4. Hit Edit
                              5. Update your location, you may need to re-upload your service account JSON to re-fetch your private key, and save. (NOTE: be sure to exactly copy the region BigQuery specifies your dataset is in.)


When executing dbt run after installing dbt-utils latest version i.e., 1.0.0 warning has generated
Error: `dbt_utils.surrogate_key` has been replaced by `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key`

Build - Why do my Fact_trips only contain a few days of data?
Make sure you use:
                              * dbt run --var ‘is_test_run: false’ or

(watch out for formatted text from this document: re-type the single quotes). If that does not work, use --vars '{'is_test_run': 'false'}' with each phrase separately quoted.


Build - Why do my fact_trips only contain one month of data?
Check if you specified if_exists argument correctly when writing data from GCS to BigQuery. When I wrote my automated flow for each month of the years 2019 and 2020 for green and yellow data I had specified if_exists="replace" while I was experimenting with the flow setup. Once you want to run the flow for all months in 2019 and 2020 make sure to set if_exists="append" 
                              * if_exists="replace" will replace the whole table with only the month data that you are writing into BigQuery in that one iteration -> you end up with only one month in BigQuery (the last one you inserted)
                              * if_exists="append" will append the new monthly data -> you end up with data from all months


BigQuery returns an error when I try to run the dm_monthly_zone_revenue.sql model.

date_trunc('month', pickup_datetime) as revenue_month,
To this line:
date_trunc(pickup_datetime, month) as revenue_month,
Make sure that “month” isn’t surrounded by quotes!

I changed location in dbt, but dbt run still gives me an error
Remove the dataset from BigQuery which was created by dbt and run dbt run again so that it will recreate the dataset in BigQuery with the correct location


I ran dbt run without specifying variable which gave me a table of 100 rows. I ran again with the variable value specified but my table still has 100 rows in BQ.
Remove the dataset from BigQuery created by dbt and run again (with test disabled) to ensure the dataset created has all the rows.


DBT - Why am I getting a new dataset after running my CI/CD Job? / What is this new dbt dataset in BigQuery? 
Answer: when you create the CI/CD job, under ‘Compare Changes against an environment (Deferral) make sure that you select ‘ No; do not defer to another environment’ - otherwise dbt won’t merge your dev models into production models; it will create a new environment called ‘dbt_cloud_pr_number of pull request’
  

  Why do we need the Staging dataset?
Vic created three different datasets in the videos.. dbt_<name> was used for development and you used a production dataset for the production environment. What was the use for the staging dataset?


R: Staging, as the name suggests, is like an intermediate between the raw datasets and the fact and dim tables, which are the finished product, so to speak. You'll notice that the datasets in staging are materialised as views and not tables.
Vic didn't use it for the project, you just need to create production and dbt_name + trips_data_all that you had already.

                              1. On Profile Settings > Linked Accounts connect your Github account with dbt project allowing the permissions asked. More info at https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/git/connect-gith
                              2. 

  

                                 3. Disconnect your current Github’s configuration from Account Settings > Projects (analytics) > Github connection. At the bottom left appears the button Disconnect, press it.


                                 4. Once we have confirmed the change, we can configure it again. This time, choose Github and it will appear in all repositories which you have allowed to work with dbt. Select your repository and it’s ready.
  



                                 5. Go to the Deploy > job configuration’s page and go down until Triggers and now you can see the option Run on Pull Requests:
  



Compilation Error (Model 'model.my_new_project.stg_green_tripdata' (models/staging/stg_green_tripdata.sql) depends on a source named 'staging.green_trip_external' which was not found)


If you're following video DE Zoomcamp 4.3.1 - Building the First DBT Models, you may have encountered an issue at 14:25 where the Lineage graph isn't displayed and a Compilation Error occurs, as shown in the attached image. Don't worry - a quick fix for this is to simply save your schema.yml file. Once you've done this, you should be able to view your Lineage graph without any further issues.
  





Compilation Error in test accepted_values_stg_green_tripdata_Payment_type__False___var_payment_type_values_ (models/staging/schema.yml)
  'NoneType' object is not iterable
  > in macro test_accepted_values (tests/generic/builtin.sql)
 > called by test accepted_values_stg_green_tripdata_Payment_type__False___var_payment_type_values_ (models/staging/schema.yml)


Remember that you have to add to dbt_project.yml the vars:


vars:
  payment_type_values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]




dbt macro errors with get_payment_type_description(payment_type)
You will face this issue if you copied and pasted the exact macro directly from data-engineering-zoomcamp repo.
BigQuery adapter: Retry attempt 1 of 1 after error: BadRequest('No matching signature for operator CASE for argument types: STRING, INT64, STRING, INT64, STRING, INT64, STRING, INT64, STRING, INT64, STRING, INT64, STRING, NULL at [35:5]; reason: invalidQuery, location: query, message: No matching signature for operator CASE for argument types: STRING, INT64, STRING, INT64, STRING, INT64, STRING, INT64, STRING, INT64, STRING, INT64, STRING, NULL at [35:5]')


What you’d have to do is to change the data type of the numbers (1, 2, 3 etc.) to text by inserting ‘’, as the initial ‘payment_type’ data type should be string (Note: I extracted and loaded the green trips data using Google BQ Marketplace)
 {#
    This macro returns the description of the payment_type
#}


{% macro get_payment_type_description(payment_type) -%}


    case {{ payment_type }}
        when '1' then 'Credit card'
        when '2' then 'Cash'
        when '3' then 'No charge'
        when '4' then 'Dispute'
        when '5' then 'Unknown'
        when '6' then 'Voided trip'
    end


{%- endmacro %}


  



Troubleshooting in dbt:
The dbt error  log contains a link to BigQuery. When you follow it you will see your query and the problematic line will be highlighted.




Why changing the target schema to “marts” actually creates a schema named “dbt_marts” instead?
It is a default behaviour of dbt to append custom schema to initial schema. To override this behaviour simply create a macro named “generate_schema_name.sql”:


{% macro generate_schema_name(custom_schema_name, node) -%}
    {%- set default_schema = target.schema -%}
    {%- if custom_schema_name is none -%}
        {{ default_schema }}
    {%- else -%}
        {{ custom_schema_name | trim }}
    {%- endif -%}
{%- endmacro %}


Now you can override default custom schema in “dbt_project.yml”:








How to set subdirectory of the github repository as the dbt project root
There is a project setting which allows you to set `Project subdirectory` in dbt cloud:
  



Compilation Error : Model 'model.XXX' (models/<model_path>/XXX.sql) depends on a source named '<a table name>' which was not found


Remember that you should modify accordingly your .sql models, to read from existing table names in BigQuery/postgres db
Example: select * from {{ source('staging',<your table name in the database>') }}




Compilation Error : Model '<model_name>' (<model_path>) depends on a node named '<seed_name>' which was not found   (Production Environment)


Make sure that you create a pull request from your Development branch to the Production branch (main by default). After that, check in your ‘seeds’ folder if the seed file is inside it.
Another thing to check is your .gitignore file. Make sure that the .csv extension is not included.




When executing dbt run after using fhv_tripdata as an external table: you get “Access Denied: BigQuery BigQuery: Permission denied”
1. Go to your dbt cloud service account
1. Adding the  [Storage Object Admin,Storage Admin] role in addition tco BigQuery Admin.


How to automatically infer the column data type (pandas missing value issues)?
Problem: when injecting data to bigquery, you may face the type error. This is because pandas by default will parse integer columns with missing value as float type. 
Solution: 
                                 * One way to solve this problem is to specify/ cast data type Int64 during the data transformation stage.
                                 * However, you may be lazy to type all the int columns. If that is the case, you can simply use convert_dtypes to infer the data type
    # Make pandas to infer correct data type (as pandas parse int with missing as float)
    df.fillna(-999999, inplace=True)
    df = df.convert_dtypes()
    df = df.replace(-999999, None)


When loading github repo raise exception that ‘taxi_zone_lookup’ not found
Seed files loaded from directory with name ‘seed’, that’s why you should rename dir with name ‘data’ to ‘seed’
‘taxi_zone_lookup’ not found
Check the .gitignore file and make sure you don’t have *.csv in it

Dbt error 404 was not found in location
My specific error:
Runtime Error in rpc request (from remote system.sql) 404 Not found: Table dtc-de-0315:trips_data_all.green_tripdata_partitioned was not found in location europe-west6 Location: europe-west6 Job ID: 168ee9bd-07cd-4ca4-9ee0-4f6b0f33897c
Make sure all of your datasets have the correct region and not a generalised region:
Europe-west6 as opposed to EU

Match this in dbt settings:
dbt -> projects -> optional settings -> manually set location to match


Data type errors when ingesting with parquet files

The easiest way to avoid these errors is by ingesting the relevant data in a .csv.gz file type. Then, do:
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `dtc-de.trips_data_all.fhv_tripdata`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'CSV',
  uris = ['gs://dtc_data_lake_dtc-de-updated/data/fhv_all/fhv_tripdata_2019-*.csv.gz']
);
As an example. You should no longer have any data type issues for week 4.


Inconsistent number of rows when re-running fact_trips model
This is due to the way the deduplication is done in the two staging files.


Solution: add order by in the partition by part of both staging files. Keep adding columns to order by until the number of rows in the fact_trips table is consistent when re-running the fact_trips model.


Explanation (a bit convoluted, feel free to clarify, correct etc.)


We partition by vendor id and pickup_datetime and choose the first row (rn=1) from all these partitions. These partitions are not ordered, so every time we run this, the first row might be a different one. Since the first row is different between runs, it might or might not contain an unknown borough. Then, in the fact_trips model we will discard a different number of rows when we discard all values with an unknown borough.


Data Type Error when running fact table
If you encounter data type error on trip_type column, it may due to some nan values that isn’t null in bigquery.


Solution: try casting it to FLOAT datatype instead of NUMERIC


CREATE TABLE has columns with duplicate name locationid.
This error could result if you are using some select * query without mentioning the name of table for ex: 


with dim_zones as (
    select * from `engaged-cosine-374921`.`dbt_victoria_mola`.`dim_zones`
    where borough != 'Unknown'
),


fhv as (
    select * from `engaged-cosine-374921`.`dbt_victoria_mola`.`stg_fhv_tripdata`
)
select * from fhv
inner join dim_zones as pickup_zone
on fhv.PUlocationID = pickup_zone.locationid
inner join dim_zones as dropoff_zone
on fhv.DOlocationID = dropoff_zone.locationid
    );


To resolve just replace use : select fhv.* from fhv
  


Bad int64 value: 0.0 error


Some ehail fees are null and casting them to integer gives Bad int64 value: 0.0 error, 
Solution:
Using safe_cast returns NULL instead of throwing an error. So use safe_cast from dbt_utils function in the jinja code for casting into integer as follows:
 {{ dbt_utils.safe_cast('ehail_fee',  api.Column.translate_type("integer"))}} as ehail_fee,
Can also just use safe_cast(ehail_fee as integer) without relying on dbt_utils.
Bad int64 value: 2.0/1.0 error


You might encounter this when building the fact_trips.sql model. The issue may be with the payment_type_description field. 
Using safe_cast as above, would cause the entire field to become null. A better approach is to drop the offending decimal place, then cast to integer. 
cast(replace({{ payment_type }},'.0','') as integer)
Bad int64 value: 1.0 error (again)

I found that there are more columns causing the bad INT64: ratecodeid and trip_type on Green_tripdata table.
You can use the queries below to address them:
CAST(
        REGEXP_REPLACE(CAST(rate_code AS STRING), r'\.0', '') AS INT64
    ) AS ratecodeid,
CAST(
        CASE
            WHEN REGEXP_CONTAINS(CAST(trip_type AS STRING), r'\.\d+') THEN NULL
            ELSE CAST(trip_type AS INT64)
        END AS INT64
    ) AS trip_type,


DBT - Error on building fact_trips.sql: Parquet column 'ehail_fee' has type DOUBLE which does not match the target cpp_type INT64. File: gs://<gcs bucket>/<table>/green_taxi_2019-01.parquet")
The two solution above don’t work for me - I used the line below in `stg_green_trips.sql` to replace the original ehail_fee line:
`{{ dbt.safe_cast('ehail_fee',  api.Column.translate_type("numeric"))}} as ehail_fee,`
The - vars argument must be a YAML dictionary, but was of type str
Remember to add a space between the variable and the value. Otherwise, it won't be interpreted as a dictionary.
It should be:
dbt run --var 'is_test_run: false'

In my case, I was set up in a different branch, so always check the branch you are working on. Change the 04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/models/staging/schema.yml file in the 
sources:
  - name: staging
    database: your_database_name
If this error will continue when running dbt job, As for changing the branch for your job, you can use the ‘Custom Branch’ settings in your dbt Cloud environment. This allows you to run your job on a different branch than the default one (usually main). To do this, you need to:


Go to an environment and select Settings to edit it
Select Only run on a custom branch in General settings
Enter the name of your custom branch (e.g. HW)
Click Save










Could not parse the dbt project. please check that the repository contains a valid dbt project


Running the Environment on the master branch causes this error, you must activate “Only run on a custom branch” checkbox and specify the branch you are  working when Environment is setup.




  





Made change to your modelling files and commit the your development branch, but Job still runs on old file?
Change to main branch, make a pull request from the development branch.
Note: this will take you to github.
Approve the merging and rerun you job, it would work as planned now






Setup - I’ve set Github and Bigquery to dbt successfully. Why nothing showed in my Develop tab?
Before you can develop some data model on dbt, you should create development environment and set some parameter on it. After the model being developed, we should also create deployment environment to create and run some jobs.

BigQuery returns an error when i try to run ‘dbt run’: 
My taxi data was loaded into gcs with etl_web_to_gcs.py script that converts csv data into parquet. Then I placed raw data trips into external tables and when I executed dbt run I got an error message: Parquet column 'passenger_count' has type INT64 which does not match the target cpp_type DOUBLE. It is because several columns in files have different formats of data. 
When I added df[col] = df[col].astype('Int64') transformation to the columns: passenger_count, payment_type, RatecodeID, VendorID, trip_type it went ok. Several people also faced this error and more about it you can read on the slack channel.

Google Cloud BigQuery Location Problems
When running a query on BigQuery sometimes could appear a this table is not on the specified location error.
For this problem there is not a straightforward solution, you need to dig a little, but the problem could be one of these:
                                 * Check the locations of your bucket, datasets and tables. Make sure they are all on the same one.
                                 * Change the query settings to the location you are in: on the query window select more -> query settings -> select the location
                                 * Check if all the paths you are using in your query to your tables are correct: you can click on the table -> details -> and copy the path.


DBT Deploy - This dbt Cloud run was cancelled because a valid dbt project was not found.
                                 1. This happens because we have moved the dbt project to another directory on our repo. 
                                 2. Or might be that you’re on a different branch than is expected to be merged from / to.
Solution:
Go to the projects window on dbt cloud -> settings -> edit -> and add directory (the extra path to the dbt project)
For example:
/week5/taxi_rides_ny
Make sure your file explorer path and this Project settings path matches and there’s no files waiting to be committed to github if you’re running the job to deploy to PROD. 
  

  

And that you had setup the PROD environment to check in the main branch, or whichever you specified. 
In the picture below, I had set it to ella2024 to be checked as “production-ready” by the “freshness” check mark at the PROD environment settings. So each time I merge a branch from something else into ella2024 and then trigger the PR, the CI check job would kick-in. But we still do need to Merge and close the PR manually, I believe, that part is not automated. 
  

You set up the PROD custom branch (if not default main) in the Environment setup screen.
  



DBT Deploy + CI - Location Problems on BigQuery


When you are creating the pull request and running the CI, dbt is creating a new schema on BIgQuery. By default that new schema will be created on ‘US’ location, if you have your dataset, schemas and tables on ‘EU’ that will generate an error and the pull request will not be accepted. To change that location to ‘EU’ on the connection to BigQuery from dbt we need to add the location ‘EU’ on the connection optional settings:
Dbt -> project -> settings -> connection BIgQuery -> OPtional Settings -> Location -> EU


DBT Deploy - Error When trying to run the dbt project on Prod
When running trying to run the dbt project on prod there is some things you need to do and check on your own:
                                 * First Make the pull request and Merge the branch into the main.
                                 * Make sure you have the latest version, if you made changes to the repo in another place.
                                 * Check if the dbt_project.yml file is accessible to the project, if not check this solution (Dbt: This dbt Cloud run was cancelled because a valid dbt project was not found.).
                                 * Check if the name you gave to the dataset on BigQuery is the same you put on the dataset spot on the production environment created on dbt cloud.
DBT - Error: “404 Not found: Dataset <dataset_name>:<dbt_schema_name> was not found in location EU” after building from stg_green_tripdata.sql


In the step in this video (DE Zoomcamp 4.3.1 - Build the First dbt Models), after creating `stg_green_tripdata.sql` and clicking `build`, I encountered an error saying dataset not found in location EU. The default location for dbt Bigquery is the US, so when generating the new Bigquery schema for dbt, unless specified, the schema locates in the US. 


Solution: 
Turns out I forgot to specify Location to be `EU` when adding connection details. 


Develop -> Configure Cloud CLI -> Projects -> taxi_rides_ny -> (connection) Bigquery -> Edit -> Location (Optional) -> type `EU` -> Save






Homework - Ingesting FHV_20?? data
Issue: If you’re having problems loading the FHV_20?? data from the github repo into GCS and then into BQ (input file not of type parquet), you need to do two things. First, append the URL Template link with ‘?raw=true’ like so:

URL_TEMPLATE = URL_PREFIX + "/fhv_tripdata_{{ execution_date.strftime(\'%Y-%m\') }}.parquet?raw=true"


Second, update make sure the URL_PREFIX is set to the following value:

URL_PREFIX = "https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/blob/master/nyc-tlc/fhv"
It is critical that you use this link with the keyword blob. If your link has ‘tree’ here, replace it. Everything else can stay the same, including the curl -sSLf command. ‘
Homework - Ingesting NYC TLC Data
I found out that the easies way to upload datasets form github for the homework is utilising this script git_csv_to_gcs.py. Thank you Lidia!!
It is similar to a script that Alexey provided us in 03-data-warehouse/extras/web_to_gcs.py
How to set environment variable easily for any credentials
If you have to securely put your credentials for a project and, probably, push it to a git repository then the best option is to use an environment variable 
For example for web_to_gcs.py or git_csv_to_gcs.py we have to set these variables:
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
GCP_GCS_BUCKET
The easises option to do it  is to use .env  (dotenv).
Install it and add a few lines of code that inject these variables for your project
pip install python-dotenv


from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os


# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()


# Now you can access environment variables like GCP_GCS_BUCKET and GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
credentials_path = os.getenv("GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS")
BUCKET = os.environ.get("GCP_GCS_BUCKET")


Invalid date types after Ingesting FHV data through CSV files: Could not parse 'pickup_datetime' as a timestamp

If you uploaded manually the fvh 2019 csv files, you may face errors regarding date types. Try to create an the external table in bigquery but define the pickup_datetime and dropoff_datetime to be strings
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `gcp_project.trips_data_all.fhv_tripdata`  (
    dispatching_base_num STRING,
    pickup_datetime STRING,
    dropoff_datetime STRING,
    PUlocationID STRING,
    DOlocationID STRING,
    SR_Flag STRING,
    Affiliated_base_number STRING
)
OPTIONS (
    format = 'csv',
    uris = ['gs://bucket/*.csv']
);


Then when creating the fhv core model in dbt, use TIMESTAMP(CAST(()) to ensure it first parses as a string and then convert it to timestamp.
with fhv_tripdata as (
    select * from {{ ref('stg_fhv_tripdata') }}
),
dim_zones as (
    select * from {{ ref('dim_zones') }}
    where borough != 'Unknown'
)
select fhv_tripdata.dispatching_base_num,
    TIMESTAMP(CAST(fhv_tripdata.pickup_datetime AS STRING)) AS pickup_datetime,
    TIMESTAMP(CAST(fhv_tripdata.dropoff_datetime AS STRING)) AS dropoff_datetime,


Invalid data types after Ingesting FHV data through parquet files: Could not parse SR_Flag as Float64,Couldn’t parse datetime column as timestamp,couldn’t handle NULL values in PULocationID,DOLocationID

If you uploaded manually the fvh 2019 parquet files manually after downloading from https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/fhv_tripdata_2019-*.parquet you may face errors regarding date types while loading the data in a landing table (say fhv_tripdata). Try to create an the external table with the schema defines as following and load each month in a loop.
-----Correct load with schema defination----will not throw error----------------------
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `dw-bigquery-week-3.trips_data_all.external_tlc_fhv_trips_2019` (
    dispatching_base_num STRING,
    pickup_datetime TIMESTAMP,
    dropoff_datetime TIMESTAMP,
    PUlocationID FLOAT64,
    DOlocationID FLOAT64,
    SR_Flag FLOAT64,
    Affiliated_base_number STRING
)
OPTIONS (
  format = 'PARQUET',
  uris = ['gs://project id/fhv_2019_8.parquet']
);
Can Also USE  uris = ['gs://project id/fhv_2019_*.parquet'] (THIS WILL remove the need for the loop and can be done for all month in single RUN )

How does dbt handle dependencies between models?


Ans: Dbt provides a mechanism called "ref" to manage dependencies between models. By referencing other models using the "ref" keyword in SQL, dbt automatically understands the dependencies and ensures the correct execution order.


Loading FHV Data goes into slumber using Mage?
Try loading the data using jupyter notebooks in a local environment. There might be bandwidth issues with Mage. 
Load the data into a pandas dataframe using the urls, make necessary transformations, upload the gcp bucket / alternatively download the parquet/csv files locally and then upload to GCP manually. 


Region Mismatch in DBT and BigQuery
If you are using the datasets copied into BigQuery from BigQuery public datasets, the region will be set as US by default and hence it is much easier to set your dbt profile location as US while transforming the tables and views. 
You can change the location as follows:
  

  



What is the fastest way to upload taxi data to dbt-postgres?
Use the PostgreSQL COPY FROM feature that is compatible with csv files

Setting up Java and Spark (with PySpark) on Linux (Alternative option using SDKMAN)
                                 1. Install SDKMAN:
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
                                 2. Using SDKMAN, install Java 11 and Spark 3.3.2:
sdk install java 11.0.22-tem
sdk install spark 3.3.2
Open a new terminal or run the following in the same shell:
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
                                 3. Verify the locations and versions of Java and Spark that were installed:
echo $JAVA_HOME
java -version
echo $SPARK_HOME
spark-submit --version
PySpark - Setting Spark up in Google Colab
If you’re seriously struggling to set things up "locally" (here locally meaning non/partly-managed environment like own laptop, a VM or Codespaces) you can use the following guide to use Spark in Google Colab:
https://medium.com/gitconnected/launch-spark-on-google-colab-and-connect-to-sparkui-342cad19b304 
Starter notebook:
https://github.com/aaalexlit/medium_articles/blob/main/Spark_in_Colab.ipynb 
It’s advisable to spend some time setting things up locally rather than jumping right into this solution.
Spark-shell: unable to load native-hadoop library for platform - Windows
If after installing Java (either jdk or openjdk), Hadoop and Spark, and setting the corresponding environment variables you find the following error when spark-shell is run at CMD:
java.lang.IllegalAccessError: class org.apache.spark.storage.StorageUtils$ (in unnamed module @0x3c947bc5) cannot access class sun.nio.ch.DirectBuffer (in module java.base) because module java.base does not export sun.nio.ch to unnamed 
module @0x3c947bc5


Solution: Java 17 or 19 is not supported by Spark. Spark 3.x: requires Java 8/11/16. Install Java 11 from the website provided in the windows.md setup file.
PySpark - Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store, or disable this shortcut from Settings > Manage App Execution Aliases.
I found this error while executing the user defined function in Spark (crazy_stuff_udf). I am working on Windows and using conda. After following the setup instructions, I found that the PYSPARK_PYTHON environment variable was not set correctly, given that conda has different python paths for each environment.
Solution:
                                 *  pip install findspark on the command line inside proper environment
                                 * Add to the top of the script
import findspark
findspark.init()


PySpark - TypeError: code() argument 13 must be str, not int  , while executing `import pyspark`  (Windows/ Spark 3.0.3 - Python 3.11)


This is because Python 3.11 has some inconsistencies with such an old version of Spark. The solution is a downgrade in the Python version. Python 3.9 using a conda environment takes care of it. Or install newer PySpark >= 3.5.1 works for me (Ella) [source].


Java+Spark - Easy setup with miniconda env (worked on MacOS)
If anyone is a Pythonista or becoming one (which you will essentially be one along this journey), and desires to have all python dependencies under same virtual environment (e.g. conda) as done with prefect and previous exercises, simply follow these steps


                                 1. Install OpenJDK 11, 
                                 1. on MacOS: $ brew install java11
                                 2. Add export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@11/bin:$PATH"
to ~/.bashrc or ~/zshrc
                                 2. Activate working environment (by pipenv / poetry / conda)
                                 3. Run $ pip install pyspark
                                 4. Work with exercises as normal


All default commands of spark will be also available at shell session under activated enviroment.


Hope this can help!


P.s. you won’t need findspark to firstly initialize.




Py4J - Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling (...)  java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: no further information; 
If you're getting `Py4JavaError` with a generic root cause, such as the described above (Connection refused: no further information). You're most likely using incompatible versions of the JDK or Python with Spark.

As of the current latest Spark version (3.5.0), it supports JDK 8 / 11 / 17. All of which can be easily installed with SDKMan! on macOS or Linux environments

$ sdk install java 17.0.10-librca
$ sdk install spark 3.5.0
$ sdk install hadoop 3.3.5

As PySpark 3.5.0 supports Python 3.8+ make sure you're setting up your virtualenv with either 3.8 / 3.9 / 3.10 / 3.11 (Most importantly avoid using 3.12 for now as not all libs in the data-science/engineering ecosystem are fully package for that)


$ conda create -n ENV_NAME python=3.11
$ conda activate ENV_NAME
$ pip install pyspark==3.5.0


This setup makes installing `findspark` and the likes of it unnecessary. Happy coding.


Py4J - Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o54.parquet. Or any kind of Py4JJavaError that show up after run df.write.parquet('zones')(On window)


This assume you already correctly set up the PATH in the nano ~/.bashrc
Here my 
export JAVA_HOME="/c/tools/jdk-11.0.21"
export PATH="${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"


export HADOOP_HOME="/c/tools/hadoop-3.2.0"
export PATH="${HADOOP_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"


export SPARK_HOME="/c/tools/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3"
export PATH="${SPARK_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"


export PYTHONPATH="${SPARK_HOME}/python/:$PYTHONPATH"
export PYTHONPATH="${SPARK_HOME}spark-3.5.1-bin-hadoop3py4j-0.10.9.5-src.zip:$PYTHONPATH"
You also need to add environment variables correctly which paths to java jdk, spark and hadoop through
Go to Stephenlaye2/winutils3.3.0: winutils.exe hadoop.dll and hdfs.dll binaries for hadoop windows (github.com), download the right winutils for hadoop-3.2.0. Then create a new folder,bin and put every thing in side to make a /c/tools/hadoop-3.2.0/bin(You might not need to do this, but after testing it without the /bin I could not make it to work)
Then follow the solution in this video: How To Resolve Issue with Writing DataFrame to Local File | winutils | msvcp100.dll (youtube.com)
Remember to restart IDE and computer, After the error An error occurred while calling o54.parquet.  is fixed but new errors like o31.parquet. Or o35.parquet. appear. 






lsRuntimeError: Java gateway process exited before sending its port number


After installing all including pyspark (and it is successfully imported), but then running this script on the jupyter notebook
import pyspark
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession


spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .master("local[*]") \
    .appName('test') \
    .getOrCreate()


df = spark.read \
    .option("header", "true") \
    .csv('taxi+_zone_lookup.csv')


df.show()


it gives the error: 
RuntimeError: Java gateway process exited before sending its port number


✅The solution (for me) was:
                                 *  pip install findspark on the command line and then
                                 * Add
import findspark
findspark.init()
to the top of the script. 
Another possible solution is:
                                 * Check that pyspark is pointing to the correct location. 
                                 * Run pyspark.__file__. It should be list /home/<your user name>/spark/spark-3.0.3-bin-hadoop3.2/python/pyspark/__init__.py if you followed the videos. 
                                 * If it is pointing to your python site-packages remove the pyspark directory there and check that you have added the correct exports to you .bashrc file and that there are not any other exports which might supersede the ones provided in the course content. 


To add to the solution above, if the errors persist in regards to setting the correct path for spark,  an alternative solution for permanent path setting solve the error is  to set environment variables on system and user environment variables following this tutorial: Install Apache PySpark on Windows PC | Apache Spark Installation Guide
                                 * Once everything is installed, skip to 7:14 to set up environment variables. This allows for the environment variables to be set permanently.


Module Not Found Error in Jupyter Notebook .
Even after installing pyspark correctly on linux machine (VM ) as per course instructions, faced a module not found error in jupyter notebook . 


The solution which worked for me(use following in jupyter notebook) :
!pip install findspark
import findspark
findspark.init()


Thereafter , import pyspark and create spark contex<<t as usual
None of the solutions above worked for me till I ran !pip3 install pyspark instead !pip install pyspark.

Py4JJavaError - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'py4j'` while executing `import pyspark`
You need to look for the Py4J file and note the version of the filename. Once you know the version, you can update the export command accordingly, this is how you check yours:
` ls ${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/ ` and then you add it in the export command, mine was:
export PYTHONPATH=”${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/Py4J-0.10.9.5-src.zip:${PYTHONPATH}”
Make sure that the version under `${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/` matches the filename of py4j or you will encounter `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'py4j'` while executing `import pyspark`. 
For instance, if the file under `${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/` was `py4j-0.10.9.3-src.zip`. 
Then the export PYTHONPATH statement above should be changed to `export PYTHONPATH="${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/py4j-0.10.9.3-src.zip:$PYTHONPATH"` appropriately.
Additionally, you can check for the version of ‘py4j’ of the spark you’re using from here and update as mentioned above.


~ Abhijit Chakraborty: Sometimes, even with adding the correct version of py4j might not solve the problem. Simply run pip install py4j and problem should be resolved.
Py4J Error - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'py4j' (Solve with latest version)
If below does not work, then download the latest available py4j version with
conda install -c conda-forge py4j
Take care of the latest version number in the website to replace appropriately.   
Now add
export PYTHONPATH="${SPARK_HOME}/python/:$PYTHONPATH"
export PYTHONPATH="${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/py4j-0.10.9.7-src.zip:$PYTHONPATH"
in your  .bashrc file.




Exception: Jupyter command `jupyter-notebook` not found. 
Even after we have exported our paths correctly you may find that  even though Jupyter is installed you might not have Jupyter Noteboopgak for one reason or another. Full instructions are found here (for my walkthrough) or here (where I got the original instructions from) but are included below. These instructions include setting up a virtual environment (handy if you are on your own machine doing this and not a VM):


Full steps:
                                 1. Update and upgrade packages:
                                 1. sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
                                 2. Install Python:
                                 1. sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev
                                 3. Install Python virtualenv:
                                 1. sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade pip
                                 2. sudo -H pip3 install virtualenv
                                 4. Create a Python Virtual Environment:
                                 1. mkdir notebook
                                 2. cd notebook
                                 3. virtualenv jupyterenv
                                 4. source jupyterenv/bin/activate
                                 5. Install Jupyter Notebook:
                                 1. pip install jupyter
                                 6. Run Jupyter Notebook:
                                 1. jupyter notebook


Error java.io.FileNotFoundException
Code executed:
df = spark.read.parquet(pq_path)
… some operations on df …
df.write.parquet(pq_path, mode="overwrite")


java.io.FileNotFoundException: File file:/home/xxx/code/data/pq/fhvhv/2021/02/part-00021-523f9ad5-14af-4332-9434-bdcb0831f2b7-c000.snappy.parquet does not exist


The problem is that Sparks performs lazy transformations, so the actual action that trigger the job is df.write, which does delete the parquet files that is trying to read (mode=”overwrite”)


✅Solution: Write to a different directorydf
df.write.parquet(pq_path_temp, mode="overwrite")


Hadoop - FileNotFoundException: Hadoop bin directory does not exist , when trying to write (Windows)
You need to create the Hadoop /bin directory manually and add the downloaded files in there, since the shell script provided for Windows installation just puts them in /c/tools/hadoop-3.2.0/ .


Which type of SQL is used in Spark? Postgres? MySQL? SQL Server?


Actually Spark SQL is one independent “type” of SQL - Spark SQL.
The several SQL providers are very similar:
SELECT [attributes]
FROM [table]
WHERE [filter]
GROUP BY [grouping attributes]
HAVING [filtering the groups]
ORDER BY [attribute to order]
(INNER/FULL/LEFT/RIGHT) JOIN [table2]
ON [attributes table joining table2] (...)


What differs the most between several SQL providers are built-in functions.
For Built-in Spark SQL function check this link: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html
Extra information on SPARK SQL :
https://databricks.com/glossary/what-is-spark-sql#:~:text=Spark%20SQL%20is%20a%20Spark,on%20existing%20deployments%20and%20data. 


The spark viewer on localhost:4040 was not showing the current run
✅Solution: I had two notebooks running, and the one I wanted to look at had opened a port on localhost:4041.
If a port is in use, then Spark uses the next available port number. It can be even 4044. Clean up after yourself when a port does not work or a container does not run.
You can run spark.sparkContext.uiWebUrl
and result will be some like
'http://172.19.10.61:4041'

Spark fails when reading from BigQuery and using `.show()` on `SELECT` queries


✅I got it working using `gcs-connector-hadoop-2.2.5-shaded.jar` and Spark 3.1
I also added the google_credentials.json and .p12 to auth with gcs. These files are downloadable from GCP Service account.


To create the SparkSession:
spark = SparkSession.builder.master('local[*]') \
    .appName('spark-read-from-bigquery') \
    .config('BigQueryProjectId','razor-project-xxxxxxx) \
    .config('BigQueryDatasetLocation','de_final_data') \
    .config('parentProject','razor-project-xxxxxxx) \
    .config("google.cloud.auth.service.account.enable", "true") \
    .config("credentialsFile", "google_credentials.json") \
    .config("GcpJsonKeyFile", "google_credentials.json") \
    .config("spark.driver.memory", "4g") \
    .config("spark.executor.memory", "2g") \
    .config("spark.memory.offHeap.enabled",True) \
    .config("spark.memory.offHeap.size","5g") \
    .config('google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile', "google_credentials.json") \
    .config("fs.gs.project.id", "razor-project-xxxxxxx") \
    .config("fs.gs.impl", "com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystem") \
    .config("fs.AbstractFileSystem.gs.impl", "com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFS") \
    .getOrCreate()


Spark BigQuery connector Automatic configuration
While creating a SparkSession using the config spark.jars.packages as com.google.cloud.spark:spark-bigquery-with-dependencies_2.12:0.23.2
spark = SparkSession.builder.master('local').appName('bq').config("spark.jars.packages", "com.google.cloud.spark:spark-bigquery-with-dependencies_2.12:0.23.2").getOrCreate() 


automatically downloads the required dependency jars and configures the connector, removing the need to manage this dependency. More details available here


Spark Cloud Storage connector
Link to Slack Thread : has anyone figured out how to read from GCP data lake instead of downloading all the taxi data again?
There’s a few extra steps to go into reading from GCS with PySpark


1.)  IMPORTANT: Download the Cloud Storage connector for Hadoop here: https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/connectors/cloud-storage#clusters
As the name implies, this .jar file is what essentially connects PySpark with your GCS


2.) Move the .jar file to your Spark file directory. I installed Spark using homebrew on my MacOS machine and I had to create a /jars directory under "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/ (where my spark dir is located)


3.) In your Python script, there are a few extra classes you’ll have to import:
import pyspark
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.conf import SparkConf
from pyspark.context import SparkContext


4.) You must set up your configurations before building your SparkSession. Here’s my code snippet:
conf = SparkConf() \
    .setMaster('local[*]') \
    .setAppName('test') \
    .set("spark.jars", "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/jars/gcs-connector-hadoop3-latest.jar") \
    .set("spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.enable", "true") \
    .set("spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile", "path/to/google_credentials.json")


sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)


sc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set("fs.AbstractFileSystem.gs.impl",  "com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFS")
sc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set("fs.gs.impl", "com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystem")
sc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set("fs.gs.auth.service.account.json.keyfile", "path/to/google_credentials.json")
sc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set("fs.gs.auth.service.account.enable", "true")


5.) Once you run that, build your SparkSession with the new parameters we’d just instantiated in the previous step:
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .config(conf=sc.getConf()) \
    .getOrCreate()


6.) Finally, you’re able to read your files straight from GCS!
start-slave.sh: command not found


How can I read a small number of rows from the parquet file directly?
from pyarrow.parquet import ParquetFile
pf = ParquetFile('fhvhv_tripdata_2021-01.parquet')
#pyarrow builds tables, not dataframes
tbl_small = next(pf.iter_batches(batch_size = 1000))
#this function converts the table to a dataframe of manageable size
df = tbl_small.to_pandas()


Alternatively without PyArrow:
df = spark.read.parquet('fhvhv_tripdata_2021-01.parquet')
df1 = df.sort('DOLocationID').limit(1000)
pdf = df1.select("*").toPandas()

DataType error when creating Spark DataFrame with a specified schema?
Probably you’ll encounter this if you followed the video ‘5.3.1 - First Look at Spark/PySpark’ and used the parquet file from the TLC website (csv was used in the video). 


When defining the schema, the PULocation and DOLocationID are defined as IntegerType. This will cause an error because the Parquet file is INT64 and you’ll get an error like:
Parquet column cannot be converted in file [...] Column [...] Expected: int, Found: INT64
Change the schema definition from IntegerType to LongType and it should work

AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'iteritems'


This error comes up on the Spark video 5.3.1 - First Look at Spark/PySpark,
because as at the creation of the video, 2021 data was the most recent which utilised csv files but as at now its parquet.
So when you run the command spark.createDataFrame(df1_pandas).show(),
You get the Attribute error. This is caused by the pandas version 2.0.0 which seems incompatible with Spark 3.3.2, so to fix it you have to downgrade pandas to 1.5.3 using the command pip install -U pandas==1.5.3


Another option is adding the following after importing pandas, if one does not want to downgrade pandas version (source) : 
pd.DataFrame.iteritems = pd.DataFrame.items
Note that this problem is solved with Spark versions from 3.4.1


AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'iteritems'
Another alternative is to install pandas 2.0.1 (it worked well as at the time of writing this), and it is compatible with Pyspark 3.5.1. Make sure to add or edit your environment variable like this: 
       export SPARK_HOME="${HOME}/spark/spark-3.5.1-bin-hadoop3"
        export PATH="${SPARK_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

Export PYTHONPATH command in linux is temporary
You can either type the export command every time you run a new session, add it to the .bashrc/ which you can find in /home or run this command at the beginning of your homebook:


import findspark 
findspark.init()


Compressed file ended before the end-of-stream marker was reached
I solved this issue: unzip the file with:


f


 before creating head.csv


Compression Error: zcat output is gibberish, seems like still compressed


In the code along from Video 5.3.3 Alexey downloads the CSV files from the NYT website and gzips them in their bash script. If we now (2023) follow along but download the data from the GH course Repo, it will already be zippes as csv.gz files. Therefore we zip it again if we follow the code from the video exactly. This then leads to gibberish outcome when we then try to cat the contents or count the lines with zcat, because the file is zipped twitch and zcat only unzips it once.


✅solution: do not gzip the files downloaded from the course repo. Just wget them and save them as they are as csv.gz files. Then the zcat command and the showSchema command will also work 
URL="${URL_PREFIX}/${TAXI_TYPE}/${TAXI_TYPE}_tripdata_${YEAR}-${FMONTH}.csv.gz"
   LOCAL_PREFIX="data/raw/${TAXI_TYPE}/${YEAR}/${FMONTH}"

   LOCAL_PATH="${LOCAL_PREFIX}/${LOCAL_FILE}"


   echo "downloading ${URL} to ${LOCAL_PATH}"
   mkdir -p ${LOCAL_PREFIX}
   wget ${URL} -O ${LOCAL_PATH}
  
   echo "compressing ${LOCAL_PATH}"
   # gzip ${LOCAL_PATH} <- uncomment this line


PicklingError: Could not serialise object: IndexError: tuple index out of range.
Occurred while running : spark.createDataFrame(df_pandas).show() 
This error is usually due to the python version, since spark till date of 2 march 2023 doesn’t support python 3.11, try creating a new env with python version 3.8 and then run this command.
On the virtual machine, you can create a conda environment (here called myenv) with python 3.10 installed:
conda create -n myenv python=3.10 anaconda
Then you must run conda activate myenv to run python 3.10. Otherwise you’ll still be running version 3.11. You can deactivate by typing conda deactivate.
Connecting from local Spark to GCS - Spark does not find my google credentials as shown in the video?
Make sure you have your credentials of your GCP in your VM under the location defined in the script.


Spark docker-compose setup
To run spark in docker setup
1. Build bitnami spark docker
        a. clone bitnami repo using command
            git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
            (tested on commit 9cef8b892d29c04f8a271a644341c8222790c992)            
        b. edit file `bitnami/spark/3.3/debian-11/Dockerfile` and update java and spark version as following
                "python-3.10.10-2-linux-${OS_ARCH}-debian-11" \

How do you read data stored in gcs on pandas with your local computer?


To do this
pip install gcsfs,
Thereafter copy the uri path to the file and use 
df = pandas.read_csc(gs://path)


TypeError when using spark.createDataFrame function on a pandas df


Error:
spark.createDataFrame(df_pandas).schema
TypeError: field Affiliated_base_number: Can not merge type <class 'pyspark.sql.types.StringType'> and <class 'pyspark.sql.types.DoubleType'>


Solution:


Affiliated_base_number is a mix of letters and numbers (you can check this with a preview of the table), so it cannot be set to DoubleType (only for double-precision numbers). The suitable type would be StringType. Spark  inferSchema is more accurate than Pandas infer type method in this case. You can set it to  true  while reading the csv, so you don’t have to take out any data from your dataset. Something like this can help: 


df = spark.read \
    .options( 
    header = "true", \
    inferSchema = "true", \
            ) \
    .csv('path/to/your/csv/file/')




Solution B:
It's because some rows in the affiliated_base_number are null and therefore it is assigned the datatype String and this cannot be converted to type Double. So if you really want to convert this pandas df to a pyspark df only take the  rows from the pandas df that are not null in the 'Affiliated_base_number' column. Then you will be able to apply the pyspark function createDataFrame.


# Only take rows that have no null values
pandas_df= pandas_df[pandas_df.notnull().all(1)]






MemoryManager: Total allocation exceeds 95.00% (1,020,054,720 bytes) of heap memory
Default executor memory is 1gb. This error appeared when working with the homework dataset.

Error: MemoryManager: Total allocation exceeds 95.00% (1,020,054,720 bytes) of heap memory
Scaling row group sizes to 95.00% for 8 writers[e]
	

Solution:
Increase the memory of the executor when creating the Spark session like this:

spark = SparkSession.builder \
        .master("local[*]") \
        .appName('test') \
        .config("spark.executor.memory", "4g") \
        .config("spark.driver.memory", "4g") \
        .getOrCreate()
	Remember to restart the Jupyter session (ie. close the Spark session) or the config won’t take effect.


How to spark standalone cluster is run on windows OS

Env variables set in ~/.bashrc are not loaded to Jupyter in VS Code


I added PYTHONPATH, JAVA_HOME and SPARK_HOME to ~/.bashrc, import pyspark worked ok in iPython in terminal, but couldn’t be found in .ipynb opened in VS Code


After adding new lines to ~/.bashrc, need to restart the shell to activate the new lines, do either
                                 * source ~/.bashrc
                                 * exec bash
Instead of configuring paths in ~/.bashrc, I created .env file in the root of my workspace:
JAVA_HOME="${HOME}/app/java/jdk-11.0.2"
PATH="${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"
SPARK_HOME="${HOME}/app/spark/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3"
PATH="${SPARK_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"
PYTHONPATH="${SPARK_HOME}/python/:$PYTHONPATH"

How [f]to port forward outside VS Code


I don’t use visual studio, so I did it the old fashioned way: ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 <my user>@<VM IP> (replace user and IP with the ones used by the GCP VM, e.g. : ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 myuser@34.140.188.1


hadoop“wc -l” is giving a different result then shown in the video


If you are doing wc -l fhvhv_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz  with the gzip file as the file argument, you will get a different result, obviously! Since the file is compressed.
Unzip the file and then do wc -l fhvhv_tripdata_2021-01.csv to get the right results.

When submit a job, it might throw an error about Java in log panel within Dataproc. I changed the Versioning Control when I created a cluster, so it means that I delete the cluster and created a new one, and instead of choosing Debian-Hadoop-Spark, I switch to Ubuntu 20.02-Hadoop3.3-Spark3.3 for Versioning Control feature, the main reason to choose this is because I have the same Ubuntu version in mi laptop, I tried to find documentation to sustent this but unfortunately I couldn't nevertheless it works for me.


Repartition the Dataframe to 6 partitions using df.repartition(6) - got 8 partitions instead

Jupyter Notebook or SparkUI not loading properly at localhost after port forwarding from VS code?
Possible solution - Try to forward the port using ssh cli instead of vs code.
Run > “ssh -L <local port>:<VM host/ip>:<VM port> <ssh hostname>”
ssh hostname is the name you specified in the ~/.ssh/config file
In case of Jupyter Notebook run
“ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 gcp-vm”
from your local machine’s cli.
NOTE: If you logout from the session, the connection would break. Also while creating the spark session notice the block's log because sometimes it fails to run at 4040 and then switches to 4041.


~Abhijit Chakrborty: If you are having trouble accessing localhost ports from GCP VM consider adding the forwarding instructions to .ssh/config file as following:
```
Host <hostname>
    Hostname <external-gcp-ip>
    User xxxx
    IdentityFile yyyy
    LocalForward 8888 localhost:8888
    LocalForward 8080 localhost:8080
    LocalForward 5432 localhost:5432
    LocalForward 4040 localhost:4040
```
This should automatically forward all ports and will enable accessing localhost ports.
Installing Java 11 on codespaces

Homework - how to convert the time difference of two timestamps to hours
Pyspark converts the difference of two TimestampType values to Python's native datetime.timedelta object. The timedelta object only stores the duration in terms of days, seconds, and microseconds. Each of the three units of time must be manually converted into hours in order to express the total duration between the two timestamps using only hours.
Another way for achieving this is using the datediff (sql function). It receives this parameters
                                 * Upper Date: the closest date you have. For example dropoff_datetime
                                 * Lower Date: the farthest date you have.  For example pickup_datetime
And the result is returned in terms of days, so you could multiply the result for 24 in order to get the hours.

Dataproc Qn: Is it essential to have a VM on GCP for running Dataproc and submitting jobs ?


Ans: No, you can submit a job to DataProc from your local computer by installing gsutil (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install) and configuring it. Then, you can execute the following command from your local computer. 
gcloud dataproc jobs submit pyspark \
    --cluster=de-zoomcamp-cluster \
    --region=europe-west6 \

Setting JAVA_HOME with Homebrew on Apple Silicon
The MacOS setup instruction (https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/05-batch/setup/macos.md#installing-java) for setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable is for Intel-based Macs which have a default install location at /usr/local/. If you have an Apple Silicon mac, you will have to set JAVA_HOME to /opt/homebrew/, specifically in your .bashrc or .zshrc:
export JAVA_HOME="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin"
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME:$PATH"
Confirm that your path was correctly set by running the command: which java
You should expect to see the output:
/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin/java

Module 6: streaming with kafka
Could not start docker image “control-center” from the docker-compose.yaml file.
Check Docker Compose File:
Ensure that your docker-compose.yaml file is correctly configured with the necessary details for the "control-center" service. Check the service name, image name, ports, volumes, environment variables, and any other configurations required for the container to start.
On Mac OSX 12.2.1 (Monterey) I could not start the kafka control center. I opened Docker Desktop and saw docker images still running from week 4, which I did not see when I typed “docker ps.” I deleted them in docker desktop and then had no problem starting up the kafka environment.
Module “kafka” not found when trying to run producer.py
Solution from Alexey: create a virtual environment and run requirements.txt and the python files in that environment.
To create a virtual env and install packages (run only once)


python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
To activate it (you'll need to run it every time you need the virtual env):


source env/bin/activate


To deactivate it:


deactivate
This works on MacOS, Linux and Windows - but for Windows the path is slightly different (it's env/Scripts/activate)


Also the virtual environment should be created only to run the python file. Docker images should first all be up and running.

What is the use of  Redpanda ?
Redpanda: Redpanda is built on top of the Raft consensus algorithm and is designed as a high-performance, low-latency alternative to Kafka. It uses a log-centric architecture similar to Kafka but with different underlying principles.
Redpanda is a powerful, yet simple, and cost-efficient streaming data platform that is compatible with Kafka® APIs while eliminating Kafka complexity.
Negsignal:SIGKILL while converting dta files to parquet format


Got this error because the docker container memory was exhausted. The dta file was upto 800MB but my docker container does not have enough memory to handle that. 


Solution was to load the file in chunks with Pandas, then create multiple parquet files for each dat file I was processing. This worked smoothly and the issue was resolved.

Solution: 
Downgrade your local PySpark to 3.3.1 (same as Dockerfile)
The reason for the failed connection in my case was the mismatch of PySpark versions. You can see that from the logs of spark-master in the docker container. 
Solution 2:
                                 * Check what Spark version your local machine has
                                 * pyspark –version
                                 * spark-submit –version
                                 * Add your version to SPARK_VERSION in build.sh
Python Kafka: ./spark-submit.sh streaming.py - How to check why Spark master connection fails

Run: cat logs/spark-master.out 
Check for the log when the error happened
Google the error message from there

Make sure your java version is 11 or 8. 
Check your version by: 
java --version
Check all your versions by:
/usr/libexec/java_home -V
If you already have got java 11 but just not selected as default, select the specific version by: 
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11.0.22)
(or other version of 11)

In my set up, all of the dependencies listed in gradle.build were not installed in <project_name>-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.


Solution:
In build.gradle file, I added the following at the end: 
shadowJar { 
archiveBaseName = "java-kafka-rides"
archiveClassifier = ''
 }
And then in the command line ran ‘gradle shadowjar’, and run the script from java-kafka-rides-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar created by the shadowjar

Can install Faust Library for Module 6 Python Version due to dependency conflicts? 
The Faust repository and library is no longer maintained - https://github.com/robinhood/faust 
If you do not know Java, you now have the option to follow the Python Videos 6.13 & 6.14 here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgAlVknDFlQ&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=80  and follow the RedPanda Python version here https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/06-streaming/python/redpanda_example - NOTE: I highly recommend watching the Java videos to understand the concept of streaming but you can skip the coding parts - all will become clear when you get to the Python videos and RedPanda files. 
Java Kafka: How to run producer/consumer/kstreams/etc in terminal
In the project directory, run: 
java -cp build/libs/<jar_name>-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:out src/main/java/org/example/JsonProducer.java


Java Kafka: When running the producer/consumer/etc java scripts, no results retrieved or no message sent
For example, when running JsonConsumer.java, got:
Consuming form kafka started
RESULTS:::0
RESULTS:::0
RESULTS:::0

Or when running JsonProducer.java, got:
Exception in thread "main" java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.SaslAuthenticationException: Authentication failed
Solution:
Make sure in the scripts in src/main/java/org/example/ that you are running (e.g. JsonConsumer.java, JsonProducer.java), the StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG is the correct server url (e.g. europe-west3 from example vs europe-west2)
Make sure cluster key and secrets are updated in src/main/java/org/example/Secrets.java (KAFKA_CLUSTER_KEY and KAFKA_CLUSTER_SECRET)


Java Kafka: Tests are not picked up in VSCode
Situation: in VS Code, usually there will be a triangle icon next to each test. I couldn’t see it at first and had to do some fixes. 
Solution: 
(Source)
VS Code 
→ Explorer (first icon on the left navigation bar)
  
  
→ JAVA PROJECTS (bottom collapsable)
  

→    icon next in the rightmost position to JAVA PROJECTS
→  clean Workspace 
→ Confirm by clicking Reload and Delete
Now you will be able to see the triangle icon next to each test like what you normally see in python tests.
E.g.: 
  

You can also add classes and packages in this window instead of creating files in the project directory
Confluent Kafka: Where can I find schema registry URL?
In Confluent Cloud:
Environment → default (or whatever you named your environment as) → The right navigation bar →  “Stream Governance API” →  The URL under “Endpoint” 
And create credentials from Credentials section below it


How do I check compatibility of local and container Spark versions?
You can check the version of your local spark using spark-submit --version. In the build.sh file of the Python folder, make sure that SPARK_VERSION matches your local version. Similarly, make sure the pyspark you pip installed also matches this version. 
How to fix the error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'kafka.vendor.six.moves'"?
According to https://github.com/dpkp/kafka-python/

How is my capstone project going to be evaluated?


                                 * Each submitted project will be evaluated by 3 (three) randomly assigned students that have also submitted the project. 


                                 *  You will also be responsible for grading the projects from 3 fellow students yourself. Please be aware that: not complying to this rule also implies you failing to achieve the Certificate at the end of the course.


                                 * The final grade you get will be the median score of the grades you get from the peer reviewers. 

                                 * And of course, the peer review criteria for evaluating or being evaluated must follow the guidelines defined here.
Project 1 & Project 2 
There is only ONE project for this Zoomcamp. You do not need to submit or create two projects. There are simply TWO chances to pass the course. You can use the Second Attempt if you a) fail the first attempt b) do not have the time due to other engagements such as holiday or sickness etc. to enter your project into the first attempt.

Spark Streaming - How do I read from multiple topics in the same Spark Session


Initiate a Spark Session
spark = (SparkSession
         .builder
         .appName(app_name)
         .master(master=master)
         .getOrCreate())


spark.streams.resetTerminated()




query1 = spark
                .readStream
                …
                …
                .load()


query2 = spark
                .readStream
                …
                …
                .load()


query3 = spark
                .readStream
                …
                …
                .load()


query1.start()
query2.start()
query3.start()


spark.streams.awaitAnyTermination() #waits for any one of the query to receive kill signal or error failure. This is asynchronous


# On the contrary query3.start().awaitTermination() is a blocking ex call. Works well when we are reading only from one topic.
Data Transformation from Databricks to Azure SQL DB
Transformed data can be moved in to azure blob storage and then it can be moved in to azure SQL DB, instead of moving directly from databricks to Azure SQL DB.
Orchestrating dbt with Airflow
The trial dbt account provides access to dbt API. Job will still be needed to be added manually. Airflow will run the job using a python operator calling the API. You will need to provide api key, job id, etc. (be careful not committing it to Github).
Detailed explanation here: https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-airflow-spiritual-alignment
Source code example here: https://github.com/sungchun12/airflow-toolkit/blob/95d40ac76122de337e1b1cdc8eed35ba1c3051ed/dags/examples/dbt_cloud_example.py


Orchestrating DataProc with Airflow
https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-google/stable/_api/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/dataproc/index.html


https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-google/stable/_modules/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/dataproc.html


Give the following roles to you service account:
                                    * DataProc Administrator
                                    * Service Account User (explanation here)


Use DataprocSubmitPySparkJobOperator, DataprocDeleteClusterOperator and  DataprocCreateClusterOperator.


When using  DataprocSubmitPySparkJobOperator, do not forget to add:
dataproc_jars = ["gs://spark-lib/bigquery/spark-bigquery-with-dependencies_2.12-0.24.0.jar"]


Because DataProc does not already have the BigQuery Connector.
Orchestrating dbt cloud with Mage
You can trigger your dbt job in Mage pipeline. For this get your dbt cloud api key under settings/Api tokens/personal tokens. Add it safely to  your .env 
For example
  dbt_api_trigger=dbt_**


Navigate to job page and find api trigger  link
  
  
 Then create a custom mage Python block with a simple http request like here
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pathlib import Path
dotenv_path = Path('/home/src/.env')
load_dotenv(dotenv_path=dotenv_path)
dbt_api_trigger= os.getenv(dbt_api_trigger) 
url = f"https://cloud.getdbt.com/api/v2/accounts/{dbt_account_id}/jobs/<job_id>/run/"
    headers = {
       "Authorization": f"Token {dbt_api_trigger}",
       "Content-Type": "application/json" }
    body = {
       "cause": "Triggered via API"
    }
   response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=body)


voila! You triggered dbt job form your mage pipeline.


Project evaluation - Reproducibility
The slack thread : thttps://datatalks-club.slack.com/archives/C01FABYF2RG/p1677678161866999


The question is that sometimes even if you take plenty of effort to document every single step, and we can't even sure if the person doing the peer review will be able to follow-up, so how this criteria will be evaluated?


Alex clarifies: “Ideally yes, you should try to re-run everything. But I understand that not everyone has time to do it, so if you check the code by looking at it and try to spot errors, places with missing instructions and so on - then it's already great”


Key Vault in Azure cloud stack


The key valut in Azure cloud is used to store credentials or passwords or secrets of different tech stack used in Azure. For example if u do not want to expose the password in SQL database, then we can save the password under a given name and use them in other Azure stack.




Spark docker - `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'py4j'` while executing `import pyspark`
You can get the version of py4j from inside docker using this command
docker exec -it --user airflow airflow-airflow-scheduler-1 bash -c "ls /opt/spark/python/lib"
psycopg2 complains of incompatible environment e.g x86 instead of amd
Either use conda or pip for managing venv, using both of them together will cause incompatibility.
If you’re using conda, install psycopg2 using the conda-forge channel, which may handle the architecture compatibility automatically
        conda install -c conda-forge psycopg2
If pip, do the normal install
        pip install psycopg2






Setting up dbt locally with Docker and Postgres
This is not a FAQ but more of an advice if you want to set up dbt locally, I did it in the following way:
I had the postgres instance from week 2 (year 2024) up (the docker-compose)
mkdir dbt
vi dbt/profiles.yml 
        And here I attached this content (only the required fields) and replaced them with the proper values (for instance mine where in the .env file of the folder of week 2 docker stuff)
cd dbt && git clone https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-starter-project
mkdir project && cd project && mv dbt-starter-project/* . 
        Make sure that you align the profile name in profiles.yml with the dbt_project.yml file
Add this line anywhere on the dbt_project.yml file:
        config-version: 2
docker run --network=mage-zoomcamp_default --mount type=bind,source=/<your-path>/dbt/project,target=/usr/app --mount type=bind,source=/<your-path>/profiles.yml,target=/root/.dbt/profiles.yml ghcr.io/dbt-labs/dbt-postgres ls
If you have trouble run 
docker run --network=mage-zoomcamp_default --mount type=bind,source=/<your-path>/dbt/project,target=/usr/app --mount type=bind,source=/<your-path>/profiles.yml,target=/root/.dbt/profiles.yml ghcr.io/dbt-labs/dbt-postgres debug

How to run a dbt-core project as an Airflow Task Group on Google Cloud Composer using a service account JSON key
                                    1. Install the astronomer-cosmos package as a dependency. (see Terraform example).
                                    2. Make a new folder, dbt/, inside the dags/ folder of your Composer GCP bucket and copy paste your dbt-core project there. (see example)
                                    3. Ensure your profiles.yml is configured to authenticate with a service account key. (see BigQuery example)
                                    4. Create a new DAG using the DbtTaskGroup class and a ProfileConfig specifying a profiles_yml_filepath that points to the location of your JSON key file. (see example)
                                    5. Your dbt lineage graph should now appear as tasks inside a task group like this:

Workshop 1 - dlthub

How do I install the necessary dependencies to run the code?
        Answer: To run the provided code, ensure that the 'dlt[duckdb]' package is installed. You can do this by executing the provided installation command: !pip install dlt[duckdb]. If you’re doing it locally, be sure to also have duckdb pip installed (even before the duckdb package is loaded).
Other packages needed but not listed
        If you are running Jupyter Notebook on a fresh new Codespace or in local machine with a new Virtual Environment, you will need this package to run the starter Jupyter Notebook offered by the teacher. Execute this:

pip install jupyter



How can I use DuckDB In-Memory database with dlt ?
import dlt
import duckdb

conn = duckdb.connect()




def my_generator_fn():
   # implement your generator function
   pass


pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
   pipeline_name='my_pipeline',
   destination=dlt.destinations.duckdb(conn),
   dataset_name='dlt',
)




pipeline.run(
   my_generator_fn, 
   table_name='my_table',
   write_disposition='replace',
)


print(conn.sql("SELECT * FROM dlt.my_table"))


conn.close()
	
Alternatively, you can switch to in-file storage with:
# In-Memory database storage
conn = duckdb.connect()


# File database storage
conn = duckdb.connect("/path/to/your/db.duckdb")
	

Homework - dlt Exercise 3 - Merge a generator concerns

psql - command not found: psql (alternative install)
psql is a command line tool that is installed alongside PostgreSQL DB, but since we've always been running PostgreSQL in a container, you've only got `pgcli`, which lacks the feature to run a sql script into the DB. Besides, having a command line for each database flavor you'll have to deal with as a Data Professional is far from ideal. 
So, instead, you can use usql. Check the docs for details on how to install for your OS. On macOS, it supports `homebrew`, and on Windows, it supports scoop.
So, to run the taxi_trips.sql script with usql:
usql postgres://root@localhost:4566/dev -f  path/to/taxi_trips.sql
	



Setup - source command.sh - error: “docker-compose” not found
If you encounter this error and are certain that you have docker compose installed, but typically run it as docker compose without the hyphen, then consider editing command.sh file by removing the hyphen from ‘docker-compose’. Example:
start-cluster() {
 docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
}


Setup - start-cluster error: Invalid top-level property x-image  
ERROR: The Compose file './docker/docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
Invalid top-level property "x-image". Valid top-level sections for this Compose file are: version, services, networks, volumes, secrets, configs, and extensions starting with "x-".
You might be seeing this error because you're using the wrong Compose file version. Either specify a supported version (e.g "2.2" or "3.3") and place your service definitions under the `services` key, or omit the `version` key and place your service definitions at the root of the file to use version 1.
For more on the Compose file format versions, see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
If you encounter the above error and have docker-compose installed, try updating your version of docker-compose. At the time of reporting this issue (March 17 2024), Ubuntu does not seem to support a docker-compose version high enough to run the required docker images. If you have this error and are on a Ubuntu machine, consider starting a VM with a Debian machine or look for an alternative way to download docker-compose at the latest version on your machine.


stream-kafka Qn: Is it expected that the records are being ingested 10 at a time?
Ans: [source] Yes, it is so that we can observe the changes as we’re working on the queries in real-time. The script is changing the date timestamp to the current time, so our queries with the now()filter would work. Open another terminal tab to copy+paste the queries while the stream-kafka script is running in the background.
Noel: I have recently increased this up to 100 at a time, you may pull the latest changes from the repository.


Setup - Qn: Is kafka install required for the RisingWave workshop? [source]
Ans: No, it is not.


Setup - Qn: How much free disk space should we have? [source]
Ans: about 7GB free for all the containers to be provisioned and then the psql still needs to run and ingest the taxi data, so maybe 10gb in total?


Psycopg2 - issues when running stream-kafka script
Replace psycopg2==2.9.9 with psycopg2-binary in the requirements.txt file [source] [another]
When you open another terminal to run the psql, remember to do the source command.sh step for each terminal session


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Psycopg2 - `Could not build wheels for psycopg2, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects`
If you’re using an Anaconda installation: 
                                    * Cd home/ 
                                    * Conda install gcc 
                                    * Source back to your RisingWave Venv - source .venv/bin/activate
                                    * Pip install psycopg2-binary 
                                    * Pip install -r requirements.txt
For some reason this worked - the Conda base doesn’t have the GCC installed - (GNU Compiler Collection) a compiler system that supports various programming languages. Without this the it fails to install pyproject.toml-based projects
“It's possible that in your specific environment, the gcc installation was required at the system level rather than within the virtual environment. This can happen if the build process for psycopg2 tries to access system-level dependencies during installation.
Installing gcc in your main Python installation (Conda) would make it available system-wide, allowing any Python environment to access it when necessary for building packages.”
gcc stands for GNU Compiler Collection. It is a compiler system developed by the GNU Project that supports various programming languages, including C, C++, Objective-C, and Fortran.
GCC is widely used for compiling source code written in these languages into executable programs or libraries. It's a key tool in the software development process, particularly in the compilation stage where source code is translated into machine code that can be executed by a computer's processor.
In addition to compiling source code, GCC also provides various optimization options, debugging support, and extensive documentation, making it a powerful and versatile tool for developers across different platforms and architectures.

Psycopg2 InternalError: Failed to run the query - when running the seed-kafka command after initial setup.
Below I have listed some steps I took to rectify this and potentially other minor errors, in Windows:
                                    * Use the git bash terminal in windows.
                                    * Activate python venv from git bash: source .venv/Scripts/activate
                                    * Modify the seed_kafka.py file: in the first line, replace python3 with python.
                                    * Now from git bash, run the seed-kafka cmd. It should work now.


Additional Notes:
                                    1. You can connect to the RisingWave cluster from Powershell with the command psql -h localhost -p 4566 -d dev -U root , otherwise it asks for a password.
                                    2. The equivalent of source commands.sh  in Powershell is . .\commands.sh from the workshop directory.
Hope this can save you from some trouble in case you're doing this workshop on Windows like I am.

Running stream-kafka script gets stuck on a loop with Connection Refused
In case the script gets stuck on 
%3|1709652240.100|FAIL|rdkafka#producer-2| [thrd:localhost:9092/bootstrap]: localhost:9092/bootstrap: Connect to ipv4#127.0.0.1:9092 failed: Connection refused (after 0ms in state CONNECT)gre
after trying to load the trip data, check the logs of the message_queue container in docker. If it keeps restarting with Could not initialize seastar: std::runtime_error (insufficient physical memory: needed 4294967296 available 4067422208)  as the last message, then go to the docker-compose file in the docker folder of the project and change the ‘memory’ command for the message_queue service for some lower value.
Solution: lower the memory allocation of the service “message_queue” in your docker-compose file from 4GB. If you have the “insufficient physical memory” error message (try 3GB)


Issue: Running psql -f risingwave-sql/table/trip_data.sql after starting services with ‘default’ values using docker-compose up gives the error  “psql:risingwave-sql/table/trip_data.sql:61: ERROR:  syntax error at or near "." LINE 60:       properties.bootstrap.server='message_queue:29092'” 

Solution: Make sure you have run source commands.sh in each terminal window
For the homework questions is there a specific number of records that have to be processed to obtain the final answer?
Use seed-kafka instead of stream-kafka to get a static set of results.
Homework - Materialized view does not guarantee order by warning
It is best to use the order by and limit clause on the query to the materialized view instead of the materialized view creation in order to guarantee consistent results


Homework - The answers in the homework do not match the provided options: You must follow the following steps: 1. clean-cluster 2. docker volume prune and use seed-kafka instead of stream-kafka. Ensure that the number of records is 100K.
How to install postgress on Linux like OS
For this workshop, and if you are following the view from Noel (2024) this requires you to install postgres to use it on your terminal. Found this steps (commands) to get it done [source]:

                                    2. sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
                                    3. sudo apt update
                                    4. apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
                                    5. (comment): now let’s check the service for postgresql
                                    6. service postgresql status
                                    1. (comment) If down: use the next command
                                    2. service postgresql start
                                    7. (comment) And your are done

Resolving Python Interpreter Path Inconsistencies in Unix-like Environments
Example Error:
When attempting to execute a Python script named seed-kafka.py or server.py with the following shebang line specifying Python 3 as the interpreter:
#!/usr/bin/env python3
	Users may encounter the following error in a Unix-like environment:
/usr/bin/env: 'python3\r': No such file or directory
	This error indicates that there is a problem with the Python interpreter path specified in the shebang line. The presence of the \r character suggests that the script was edited or created in a Windows environment, causing the interpreter path to be incorrect when executed in Unix-like environments.
2 Solutions:
Either one or the other
                                    1. Update Shebang Line:
                                    * Verify Python Interpreter Path: Use the which python3 command to determine the path to the Python 3 interpreter available in the current environment.
                                    * Update Shebang Line: Open the script file in a text editor. Modify the shebang line to point to the correct Python interpreter path found in the previous step. Ensure that the shebang line is consistent with the Python interpreter path in the execution environment.
        Example Shebang Line:
#!/usr/bin/env python3
	        Replace /usr/bin/env python3 with the correct Python interpreter path found using which python3.
                                    2. Convert Line Endings:
                                    * Use the dos2unix command-line tool to convert the line endings of the script from Windows-style to Unix-style.
                                    * This removes the extraneous carriage return characters (\r), resolving issues related to unexpected tokens and ensuring compatibility with Unix-like environments.
        Example Command:
$ dos2unix server.py
$ ./server.py
	







How does windowing work in Sql?
Ans : Windowing in streaming SQL involves defining a time-based or row-based boundary for data processing. It allows you to analyze and aggregate data over specific time intervals or based on the number of events received, providing a way to manage and organize streaming data for analysis.


Encountering the error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'kafka.vendor.six.moves'" when running "from kafka import KafkaProducer" in Jupyter Notebook for Module 6 Homework?
Python 3.12.1, is not compatible with kafka-python-2.0.2. Therefore, instead of running "pip install kafka-python", you can resolve the issue by using "pip install git+https://github.com/dpkp/kafka-python.git". If you have already installed kafka-python, you need to run "pip uninstall kafka-python" before executing "pip install git+https://github.com/dpkp/kafka-python.git" to resolve the compatibility issue.


Q:In the Mage pipeline, individual blocks run successfully. However, when executing the pipeline as a whole, some blocks fail. 
A: I have the following key-value pair in io_config.yaml file configured but still Mage blocks failed to generate OAuth and authenticate with GCP: GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACC_KEY_FILEPATH: "{{ env_var('GCP_CREDENTIALS') }}". The GCP_CREDENTIALS variable holds the full path to the service account key's JSON file. Adding the following line within the failed code block resolved the issue: os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = os.environ.get('GCP_CREDENTIALS').


DBT on Mage - profiles.yml not found/dev not found in profiles.yml
This occurs because the path to profiles.yml is not correctly specified. You can rectify this by:
“export DBT_PROFILES_DBT=path/to/profiles.yml”
Eg., /home/src/magic-zoomcamp/dbt/project_name/
Do the similar for DBT_PROJECT_DIR if getting similar issue with dbt_project.yml.
Once DIRs are set,:
“dbt debug –config-dir”
This would update your paths. To maintain same path across sessions, use the path variables in your .env file.


Triggers in Mage via CLI
To add triggers in mage pipelines via CLI, you can create a trigger of type API, and copy the API links.
Eg. link: http://localhost:6789/api/pipeline_schedules/10/pipeline_runs/f3a1a4228fc64cfd85295b668c93f3b2


Then create a trigger.py as such:
import os
import requests


class MageTrigger:
    OPTIONS = {
      "<pipeline_name>": {
        "trigger_id": 10, 
        "key": "f3a1a4228fc64cfd85295b668c93f3b2"
        }
    }


    @staticmethod
    def trigger_pipeline(pipeline_name, variables=None):
        trigger_id = MageTrigger.OPTIONS[pipeline_name]["trigger_id"]
        key = MageTrigger.OPTIONS[pipeline_name]["key"]
        endpoint = f"http://localhost:6789/api/pipeline_schedules/{trigger_id}/pipeline_runs/{key}"
        headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
        payload = {}


        if variables is not None:
            payload['pipeline_run'] = {'variables': variables}


        response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=payload)
        return response


MageTrigger.trigger_pipeline("<pipeline_name>")
Finally, after the mage server is up an running, simply this command:
python trigger.py from mage directory in terminal.


Can I do data partitioning & clustering run by dbt pipeline, or I would need to do this manually in BigQuery afterwards?
You can use this configuration in your DBT model: 
{
  "field": "<field name>",
  "data_type": "<timestamp | date | datetime | int64>",
  "granularity": "<hour | day | month | year>"


  # Only required if data_type is "int64"
  "range": {
    "start": <int>,
    "end": <int>,
    "interval": <int>
  }
}   
and for clustering 
{{
  config(
    materialized = "table",
    cluster_by = "order_id",
  )
}}
